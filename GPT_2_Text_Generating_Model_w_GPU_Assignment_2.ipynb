              "['URGENT ASSISTANCE /RELATIONSHIP (P) Dear Friend, I am Mr. Ben Suleman a custom officer and work as Assistant controller of the Customs and Excise department Of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs stationed at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos-Nigeria. After the sudden death of the former Head of state of Nigeria General Sanni Abacha on June 8th 1998 his aides and immediate members of his family were arrested while trying to escape from Nigeria in a Chartered jet to Saudi Arabia with 6 trunk boxes Marked \"Diplomatic Baggage\". Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00(One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars). I declared only (5) five boxes to the government and withheld one (1) in my custody containing the sum of (US$30,000,000.00) Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting to US$55 Billion Dollars (ref:ngrguardiannews.com) of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one (1)box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as \"Precious Stones and Jewellry\" in other that its content will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we (myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team) are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means.  However as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account cannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money. Therefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to move the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries\" which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country.  This business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction. Expecting your response urgently. Best regards, Mr. Ben Suleman']"

My colleagues and I have been working secretly to move the fund out of our country and get a foreign partner to carry out this big project for us since we don't have any bank account. The transaction involved was a genuine investment in long-term investment for both of us. On completion and verification to our knowledge, this fund has been moved into a safe account overseas where it will be invested again after maturity as a secured and viable investment for both of us by our colleague whose account we are presently at. The transaction itself was concluded without any problem, and the agreement that we reached upon mutual consent and with due respect, we have agreed to execute the agreement ourselves after the transaction is successfully completed.  We will use our positions to secretly move funds out of the whole empire and even the whole former republic to come over to your country, which we will do this in strict confidence and for certain we will accomplish our project successfully.  We are still working on this transaction for our respective positions and we hope you will treat this with utmost co-operation as it is very confidential.  We will call you for a discussion after the facts. If you are not agreeable to this proposal kindly leave us a message.  It will be better if we kept it to a strictly secret according to my colleague because we don't want anyone to know about this deal because we are concerned with this issue myself.  We shall contact you immediately after we hear from you for further step by step instructions for us to proceed.  Thanks.  Best regards.

I am elisabeth Chrétien. I am 58 years of age. I am A Resident Child of deceased Husband, Late Dr. Edwin Châtelet. My husband, in fact died of cancer. My late husband, this name, after his numerous chemical works, was poisoned to death early May 1994 by my late colleagues while they were on a visit to your land.  I am a widow to Dr. Edwin Châtelet whose  husband died of cancer, the fact that her late husband did not disclose any of this to the investigators after the death of her husband, made me decide to champion a new kind of charity organisation for my husband.  I am just a 15 years old girl and just made plans to go into business, hoping that something bad would come my way.  However, after years of prayer and effort I decided to contact you for a profitable business proposal, and found you are a man of finance /legal standing. I am contacting you for a partnership that will be beneficial to both of us. I have made several arrangements to get more informations, along with other relevant documents, so that I can send you a copy of the deposit file of my late husband\\'s money, which we discovered to the Bank where we are now waiting to move forward on receiving it. Also, I have made several arrangements to keep this money safe where it will be deposited, in a private house, for our safety, while further investigation and auditing shall confirm everything. The bank and myself are currently in a custody, along with the consignments, in a security company.  The reason I made this proposal to you is to seek a business for my husband while also hoping that your assistance will be considerate when it comes to this important business, which will involve us traveling to your country for the transfer. After the successful completion of this business, you will be given 25% of the total amount, 70% will be for us. All I want for your cooperation is for you to keep this money safe and to invest your money in your country where we shall invest some of our share in the business.

', 'urgent business proposal Dear Sir/CEO I am MISS ELLIS DAVID from South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources. During the current tenure of the former President, I made several series of costly and unsuccessful attempts but all went astray as corrupt officials.  My findings were uncovered by a foreign contractor working with me to  overcharge him with US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty Five Million, Five Hundred  Thousand United States Dollars) to mine abandoned  and defaced headstone  of a major commercial firm.  Though my findings have resonated with all of my colleagues and I set out to find a way to compensate  this money-losing man with an alternative investment or service that can  compensate  him better.  Based on my knowledge base in this country in different industries, we came  across your firm located on the bank lot  that employed one of our new  employees as an offshore consultant/contractor/client, working with Contract Name : DESIGNATED FOR  PROFESSIONAL USE OR (DC NN) CINEMA/CERTIFICATE OF  COMPANY TO COME OVER AND ASSIST  MY MOTHER AND FATHER  TO RECEIVE DIPLOMATIC EXPENSES.  However, my mother and  father died since we have been victims of mosquito  infestations in our country while my  father was in administration of an African country government  Awarding Federal Contract money to a prominent businessman.  My father was a wealthy Gold-  mining magnate, made several bankruptcies in his life and most  of all, he did not manage to cover up his banking  position in my name for the federal government Awarding Federal Contract.  Consequently  my late father gave me a notice to provide him with  the sum of US$25.2 M (Twenty Two Million, Five Hundred Thousand  United States Dollars).  I believe that this money is the bonafide next of  kin to my late father and intend to use it  for investments and to invest in any lucrative  business or industry. It is my duty as an Executive Accountant  and Attorney to ensure that the funds are transfered to the  bank account of a foreigner.  I will take over as foreign account the account  administrator the account for the safety of the deceased and the  safety of the beneficiary .There is currently no risk  to the account.  Your advise and capacity as a person of the art is of  immense interest to me as it may be after considering  the experiences of other African nations who treat foreign clients with  utmost  secrecy and as if the same old suspicion. I have  decided to give you twenty two million  united states dollars as the  ultimate compensation, after which I will arrange for a  telephone  and fax  communications with the beneficiary for the transfer  of the fund.  Accordingly, the banking law and guidelines  that govern the transfer of fund for the bank  is that if such funds as have been transferred  to the bank before my late father's death remain  unclaimed after four years, the amount  transferred will be forfeited to the Bank for  nothing. Therefore, I will like you to provide  immediately the next of kin or relation who should know the  truth about this fund and to obtain a will  bearing the funds for this transaction.  The money will be paid to you for us to share in  the ratio of 50% for me and my family and 35%  for you and me and the balance of Three Million  United States Dollars. If you are interested  in assisting me, please reply immediately via  my email address  so we can proceed with the business.  Upon receipt of your response  I will send to you by fax  mail the text of the will and the  will affidavit which we will use to bind together the  bank account and carry out the business We will have  a whole lotus offering when the money  is paid In your will.  I will guarantee that this business is 100% risk free and sustainably  concluded.  You may also call me on my mobile phone 234-70-35-35-70 for  international clearance If you wish to proceed directly  with us, the matter needs to be concluded quickly before we  expose it to any of our close friends on the outside but on the  inside it  is very very very suprising.

It is my sincere hope that  this request will bring you some assistance which can be interpreted as  assistance in an investment in your country.  I am interested in selling my first melon and should need your  permission to do so in your country. My name is Boris Honi, I am 24 years of age.  My real father was a farmer in the north of Nigeria standing partnership with my  late father. I have since lost my ability to talk and  this has particularly affected me as a result.  My present condition is that of having a hypertension medical treatment and  having recently had my hearing loss diagnosed.  Due to this, I have been suffering from semi brain fog psychosis.  My doctors have told me that I may not last for the next  six months due to brain fog and I really don't want to die  of this illness. The doctors have advised that I have only a  few months to live, and that I need to look for a partner; a life  longer  for himself.  I want to assure you that I have all the medical  aids I need to make this wish come true. The aid here is Ayu'ite  chemical concoction which I mix with my finger and use  to make the base of the melon, which I sell in candies, to mark  as family valuables and to be taken with me by my partner to  the doctor for  subsequent  and informed  dissection.  I want to assure you that I have employed all my  nerve and judgement to make this  wish come true.  Please note that I have made all manner of  front cover  needed in order to disguise the true condition of my  illness.

Well, first, I would like to know the address of the bank, which I will give  you as the next of kin to My late Boss, so that you can reach the bank and ask them any question you must ask me hence I will like to know the account structure. Further, I would like you to look for buyers abroad, whom we would like to invest  with this money, hence we have agreed that 20 percent of the total sum will be yours, while  5 percent will be for any expenses that may occur during the transaction.

Content-Type: email/ < < ; pls check if it is me or not. This is an urgent response to your question regarding the transfer of   some funds into your nominated account overseas; I am Mr. julzani khalilm ,an officer in my department. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$8.5M (Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with account number 14-2558-5976 that belongs to one of our  foreign customer who did not leave a single writing in the oversea paperwork for his payment in Kenya. On further investigation, I discovered that since the death of the deceased his  account owner has been unable to come forward to claim his share of the total sum.  Therefore, my team and I has already developed a strategy to locate any of our foreign customer who might be used as a next of kin or as the next of kin of the deceased for the transfer although it may sound strange and uncharitable to have a customer whose financial state and soul is so crashy in this case.  I am also revealing to you today that a member of our foreign customer family from the bank where the fund was deposited claim the contents of his account and says that he has just served two years' for a crime he did not commit and cannot be brought forward as next of kin, even though he was the former customer he said was ransicted and mutilated. His next of kin has not been located. The policy of our bank is that any member of our foreign customer's family more than once in our history, including this one, has had its particulars changed or have their assets/properties reported as local properties. This is unfortunate as the Nigerian Attorney/General is well known to be a foreigner who cannot stand a foreigner and a foreigner whose business it is to claim property of any kind. Hence, for the record, in my branch, I discovered on the way in coming in that the manager of Shell Petrofinery has his own delivery house in Nigeria. This is a huge Oil producing community in N. Rivers State that covers much of Plateau county, Southeastern Plateau, River State into the whole country of N.R.R. I need your assistance so that I can2  proceed in claims for my branch and these we will invest heavily in joint venture ventures together with my local partners. And we have other plans which I will share with you. My partners have already done the physical claim, however, we will invest heavily on the Internet and related fields in partnership with you. We plan to have the whole finance/security company assigned to claim the whole amount in their right of domiciliary office in their jurisdiction in the Abidjan & Cote d'Ivoire bound up our behalf.

            " in U.N.R.R.E is based on this money. I am the only son and all this money is from my late father because he is from Nigeria and I had been looking forward to having a child from his country due to his close relationship with my father. My father had a few very prosperous properties in South Asia, Europe and Asia-Pacific (Sierra Leone) as well as a large fortune in Europe and Asia-Pacific. This is why I want you to help us to collect this money from your country. I have told my mother that I will give her an application for transfer to the West African countries, because I want to go back to my father's country of South America before the arrival of foreign investors. However, because my mother did not know me, she has decided to go to any of my uncle's companies and do business in our country since she did not want her security and money-lending services exposed to foreign investment groups. Therefore, she has decided to transfer the funds to three security companies in Europe,Asia-Pacific Ltd.  and the Netherlands, but in Europe Asia-Pacific Ltd can only transfer to our sister companies because she can not operate one of our companies without her mother's permission, she has decided not to have children or get a foreign passport. It is my intention to invest in your country in your name or partnership in your countries so that our mutual wealth and wealth of your company may be used. In order to do this, your company is to be under arms guard and you need to be the one to tell the security companies to get over here; the security companies know that we will not go for a second. In order to get over here, we have to pass through each other's chambers and get over here by car. From my mother, I have no idea what her position is in relation to her position as the next of kin to my father. I have not heard from her since he was a child; she has only been in contact with my father's business for a few months now. Since then, she has not called me or told me anything; I have only been waiting for that moment; she called and she has left. But now that I know what she is going to do for my company, I don't want her to get away with this money; I want her to help me. So my mother has given me a confidential phone communication and said that she will give me the contact information of the three security companies who are sending her application to my uncle's and the Netherlands. So I can help her to send this application and also you to help her get this money as soon as we meet again to invest the money there. Once we meet again in Europe, the money will be released to you for investment as soon as you treat it as yours. For now, you can only contact my mother through my phone, but she can talk to any of her clients while you go over there as she wants to make sure we maintain a close relationship. I will prefer to have you contact other companies, because it is better off without you. Yours in good friend  John Bickford(Assalamu-Islam). \", 'ATTENTION!

My name is Mike Garza a member of an opposition political party in the country, the National Liberation Movement party (NML).  I support your confidence in this transaction and hope that this mail  gets through to you. I have a personal laptop belonging  to one of our foreign correspondents who perished in the Iraq war and we have  this as a reward for your effort and assistance.  First, let me introduce my self. I am a 30-something (56years)  from the republic of Nigeria in Nigeria.  I joined the party of the united nation democratic  coalition during the current crises in Iraq and Syria.  As the opposition political party(N.N.D.M.C)of the coalition government  to Saddam Hussein, I was mandated by the country  government to seek an honest and trustworthy foreign partner, and after serving on the  council of the united nation democratic  coalition in the country, I decided to join your party.  With my position as a civil servant at the federal  Ministry of Petroleum and Resources, I intend to solicit for your assistance to transfer  some money (US$12.5million) in the account of one of  our foreign correspondents to your  choice, so that we can invest the money in a profitable business in your country.  Based on the laws and ethics of employment, such a  transaction would require the co-operation of both parties.  The money will be transferred to your account as a  beneficiary. The former civilian account will be  frozen, while the latter will be used to purchase arms and  other needed items for the N.N.D.M.C.  It will be paid into your bank account on  behalf of my department as the beneficiary or next of kin.   Your  commission will be 35% of the total fund, 10% for  expenses and the remaining 70% is for my colleagues and myself.  It is intended that this transaction be treated as  non-criminal and it is totally safe, as every necessary  necessary documents with which I will require for  the transfer of this fund to your bank account are  already in place and all legal documentation with  which to back up the money will be provided.  Please, you have to note that this transaction involves tons of  resources and I cannot guarantee its success, unless you can be  convinced to handle it swiftly and smoothly.  We hope to have a mutual business deal in principle once  this money is transferred into your account.  Once the funds get into your reliable bank account, you  would be presented with an opportunity to earn 10% of the total  money without any strings attached.   I am aware of the negative reaction to this proposal, I need your  assistant's clearance to enable you read through  the mail to get the contents of this mail. Though I have  worked it through, people are being unreasonable  by not allowing you access to the actual document stating that there  was this money in question. All I need is your assistance and I guarantee that this will  work out for you.  If you accept to assist, we will share the proceeds 35% for  you and 10% for us, while 10% will be set aside to take care of  expenses that may arise during the course of this transaction.  In return, I  wish to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free and that everything is  100% hitch-free. I wish you all the best and may God bless you.

I got your email address from The Catholic Mailing list and  since then I have only written to seek for  forgiveness from God; to ask that there be some  trust that I was made in to you by Christ that gave you  life.I do know that this message will come to you as a surprise  because we have not known each other  before but it is the will of God.  I am Barrister John Roberts Jr.,  from Angola, the only surviving son of late Col, Roberts  Muyeke. My father was killed  during the Gulf War, but before his  death, he told me secretly in a bank in London that  he made a fixed sum of US$10.5 Million (Ten Million U.S dollars),  which he deposited into a Bank in London,  but the bank refused to allow him or issue him a bond  issued in his name.  He told me he will invest the money  on his own company if I will let you keep this  secret, but the bank acted as the finance house for the funds,  which was  in a security company on my father's arrival from Algeria.  I am just 21 years old and the son of late  former finance minister of Angola, He was later killed  by the rebels. my father after his death he informed me about  this  fund in  London. I want to invest this money in every international business  that is out in foreign, but I'm just 22 years old  and the only one who knows about this fund.  That is the reason why I am contacting you for us to do it  together. I am offering you 20% of this  fund for your assistance, while 5% will be for expenses.  I wish to apply for refugee in your  country, but I need your assistance as I think it would be safer  for me to stay there and do the work of God.  If you accept this offer, I will give you 20% of the  sum, while 60% will be for me, while 70% will be for my family,  I will invest the remaining 70% in your country and I will invest 75%  for the well being of my community as I prefer to do good  than be  victimized.  I am a Christian and I do not want to  be  preyed on, this is my reason for contacting you.  God will bless you and grant you good  understanding and compassion, if you accept my offer  please do accept my humble apology.

You will be paid 30% of the total sum for your efforts/assistance,while 10% has been set aside for any expenses that might be incurred or any other expenses that you may incure in the process of this transaction.  I look forward to your fullest co-operation.  Yours Faithfully,  Mr.Kofi Nzanga. ', \"Very urgent Dear,  Good day to you, I pray that this contact should come to you as a  positive  and save you from a lifetime of sorrow and confusion.I am from the republic of Sierria-Leone but now seeking  political asylum in Senegal- Africa. I got your contact from the website under  \"contact me\" section of internet friday night before i lost my husband and my 3 daughters in the plane crash in dakar senegal.  I got your contact through network  as i am still in the asylum camp and i have decided to contact you after  much personal searching and hard work.  I am Barrister John Bongo,a legal adviser to late Brigadier Joseph  Koffi, the former Solicitor General and the chairman of the contract award  settlement  committee in the Sudanese government.  I am contacting you to assist in collecting and investing this  fund which is presently held in a bank in the Sudanese  capital city, Svalbardom naturd.  The fund is of high origin and has been in the bank since  the fund was brought in by a foreign  contracting firm for purchase of new machines and chemicals  for the refinery and power plant  in Sudan.  The bank management has concluded that there is no viable  use for the fund which is presently held in their  account.  Consequently, they are freezing all my assets and have  also frozen all my bank accounts.  Recently, a foreign contact of mine who is a business  consultant to the late Brigadier Joseph  Koffi made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for the sum  of FiveMillions United State Dollars with my Bank in  Svalbardom naturd. This fixed  deposit is of no internal integrity and no one knows of it. I  have therefore, been to the Sudanese capital market and  discovered that the said fixed  deposit is of no internal integrity and was duly secured with the  assistance of a foreign firm. The said  firm is American, we shall discuss next time.  The amount involved is $5.2 Million. It is because of  my limited contacts and knowledge of the business  field that I have been unsuccesfull in locating the   relative of the late Brigadier Joseph Koffi, who is currently  on asylum in Senegal.   I am therefore soliciting your assistance to stand as our  next of kin to the late  Mr. Joseph Koffi, the deceased has already called  my attention to the  contract payment and the late Mr. Koffi is yet  still on the process of payment.  Conclusively, I wish you send me a confirmation email through email address so  that I can commence the process of  moving the fund out of the country to your account.  Thanks in anticipation of your valued co-operation.  Regards,  Barrister John Bongo \", 'From: Dr. Nelson Mandela Dear Friend, In the year 2000, a German American called Mr. Wolfgang Schinister, made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$26,500,000.00 (Twenty-six Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in my branch.  On  maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but  got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally, his contract employers, the Danish firm ABKSA that Mr. Schinister died in one of its aircraft  with the  ABKSA Code-named \"Davidsloot\". In February of 2002, Mr. Schinister was supposed to meet with the Danish  government regarding to the contract awarded to him by his firm. DRAFT 12/04/2006: Response from the Danish Embassy in Accra,  Denmark attached. After several days, they finally gave up on us. After further investigation, I  found out that Mr. Wolfgang Schinister  died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next  of kin was fruitless.  According to the Accra High Court of Justice,  all the  claims made for his estate  and assets, was simply wasted. Instead, he  inherited all the money accumulated from his last  contract sale of the country's main oil refinery. To  this end, I am seeking your help to claim the funds from his  contract manufacturers who done  not  contract for Mr. Schinister's product. Please kindly endow me  with your full co-operation. I have kept a close monitoring of the  account where the\n"

I am the manager, credit and foreign bills of the foreign  accounts department in African Development Bank (ADB). I came  across your contact in a profile of a late customer who died with his  entire sum of his assets in the bank's vault in my dp bank. The account  opened in my bank in April 2002 and its closing in August 2003. I was  appointed by the bank to supervise the account by the  former managing director of  the bank, that of Mr. Morris Thompson a foreigner and also a  diamond  dealer from Munich, Germany. He was to have the account  valued at  US$30m.  But due to his  age and because of the  exclusion of his immediate  family, the account was opened without his  knowledge and TREAT  IN CONFIDENCE.  By the pact of their agreement between them, the  money will remain unclaimed for twelve years,  after which the money will be transferred to their  account in their will. On this note, I got your contact as a  result of a desperate need for assistance in a  transaction.  I therefore proceed to ask for your assistance to enable the  money to be transferred into your  account.  The bank will give the documents and the right  of reply to you as the beneficiary of the said money.  We wish to start the first transfer with Twenty  five million dollars ($25,000,000.00)  upon successful transfer without any disappoint from your side, we  shall  divert the remaining balance,  Twenty five million united states dollars,  into the bank's treasury as  unclaimed after five years, and the money will be  transferred into the bank's treasury as unclaimed  account.  The money will be paid into\n"

In case you are not familiar with him or his  contact email, I recommend watching this video:  http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/02/02/uk/politics/the-second-in-second-in-second-episode-1.  http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/2002/WORLD/europe/  So get down to business now, let me see if I can get your  signature as a co-operating member of the party  standing in as the next of kin.

I want to start by thanking you for your co-operation and  I want to apply the next of kin (purchase) rights  before the 21st of January in a manner that will help us avoid confusion  with the Security Community when it comes to his claim. I have also wanted  to change the security code of every bank of this world since the very beginning  of this project, even though I don't know anything about this world, because nobody has been  portrayed as a risk in this project. Also I want to remind you of the  duties and expenses that go into this transaction, as well as the immense  reward for your services over the past few days!

            " and have agreed to provide me with the full particulars of their business. In view of your willingness we shall be able to get on with life and developing a huge business. I am SON-MRS MARIAM ABACHA,the a widow of the late Nigeria Chief Minister Maryam Abacha who died on the 8th of June,1998. Ms Abacha was the wife of Nigeria Minister of Southern Industry and Mineral Deposit KUSHI ABACHA who died on the 8th of June,2006. I am the only surviving SON-MRS MARIAM ABACHA and this e-mail address HAS ANYONE RELEASED ANYONE FOR MAKING THIS DEAL STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL?  No one but me knows the identity of the person who sent this email. WHAT A DEAL! Let's find out!  1.  I am SON-MRS MARIAM ABACHA,the wife of the late Nigeria Minister of Southern Industry and Mineral Deposit KUSHI ABACHA WHO WAS THE DUTCH, RUSSIAN MINISTER TO THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF EARTH AND AFRICAN MINISTRIES .  Dear Sir,  I write in thanks for the support and the opportunity I have in this project. I have kept all the documentations as is strictly required for this transaction, as well as all the legal documents concerning the various copyright policies and guidelines in place in our country. Also, I have arranged for you to assist me in opening up discussions with top international bodies about developing a Central Bank of South Africa (CASA) here, as is absolutely required of a leader with strong political will and an urgent and sincere desire to serve his people.  I wish to repeat however that this proposal also delights me as it will definitely give rise to an urgent and sincere discussion soon.  I would love your indulgence to receive it conditionally because I am constrained by the current state of the international banking and finance system here in South Africa.  However, if this proposal constitutes the basis for a change of attitude and decision, I will immediately equip you with all the necessary information and documents to enable us see this transaction through. I assure you that this will be most conducive to your interest and my. Engr. benefit as a result of which I will give you all the information needed to effect any transaction in this field.  This transaction, would be foiled by any means legal and appropriate to my purpose, as this would involve the payment of the principal amount of  the deposit to you, and the transfer of the balance to your local account.  I wish to repeat here, as a necessity to convey this message with your full consent and trust, I will absolutely no more allow any of my subordinates into your country to discuss about our mutual benefits or any transaction that might interest them.  This would be a total and utter breach of the trust I placed in you both, and my oath to serve my people. I wish to use this moment to introduce myself to you, I am Mrs.Somali Maryam Abacha,the wife of the late President Jonas Sonderk following the death of my husband three months ago.  I had hoped that the sudden death at the hands of the current Commander-in-chief (JIN) would bring about a change of government and lead to Abba's removal from office, hence my husband's death. But, I underestimated the strength of the Southern Movement which was building up in South Africa, as the President was highly respected in his country, he failed to act on his invitation and step down on the 15th of June. I am convinced that you would do well to exercise due indulgence to come to know and understand that my husband's life is inextricably bound by this document, as there is no other way to end this fatal emergency.  I wish to use this opportunity to inform you that this my husband's condition is very good, and the only thing I have against me is my life, as I want to have a family of my own, and this is how I died, (interrupted) by the Husband, Army General Johannes H. Brown. the only African I know, and very well educated on, who says that he has no knowledge of the War without End any more? Well, I am convinced that you would accept this as true, that the reason I got involved in this business venture is because of my husband, General, because of which I lost my husband 2 years ago.  I am making this proposal because of the financial assistance I will give you when I present you to my people to form a New Zealand National Government. As a result of this financial assistance, which guaranteed my safety and well-being, and which also made me a citizen of New Zealand, I acted on my instinct and made the decisive decision to come to this country to form a new country. I am Mrs.Somali Maryam Abacha,the daughter of the late President Jonas S\n",

I would also like to remind you that this contact is NOT an extradition request,because I am NOT an attorney. This request may seem strange, but I am an ordinary man and you should NOT seek my assistance, EVEN IF you are not his trustee.  Dear Sir,  I offer my services to you in bringing about your acceptance to be contacted by you as his trustee. This proposal  is NOT without its complications.For starters, I am an ordinary man. When I was 10 years old, my father asked my mother to kill me for being gay.  I have always been kind to my family, and I will always be to you, because I am the nephew and nephew of the late Jonas Savimbi, the former leader of the rebel rebel movement in Angola who was short dead on the 25th of February, 2002, by the opposing Angolan Army. I was under the influence of years of prescription drug abuse and therefore, I was not around to make the request, as I was not capable or particularly interested in handling a huge sum of money. But I did come over to seek his assistance, because I was interested in investing in his country. I have always been interested in business, and I am very interested in investing in your country.  I work with the Union Bank of Angola (UBA), and was one of the negotiators on a particular arms deal between Saudi Arabia and the rebels in Angola who were short dead on the 25th of February, 2002, by the Saudi Army.  I have always been interested in business, and I am very interested in investing in your country.  I want to transfer out $16 million (US$16.5M) a year ($1.6M) of our country's total funds into your account. I will give you my Tel numbers for your good convenience, IGO,so you can  assist me in making the right investment, by contacting you directly, but first I want to start by asking for your consent to assist me, in order to enrage the Saudi government and get the funds transferred into your account.  I first started working with the Saudi National Petroleum Corporation (SNPC) in December 2003, and have been working since.ispentimes since.usually to transfer out the US$16.5M (US$16.5M) a year (Seven Pounds) into your account.  I have always been interested in business, and I am very interested in investing in your country.  I want to transfer out $16.5M (US$16.5M) of your total funds into your account.  I will give you my Tel numbers for your good convenient convenience, but first I want to start by asking for your consent to assist me, in order to enable me to advance the project of my choice, by transferring out the money (US$16.5M) into your account.  I will give you my Tel numbers for your good convenient convenience, but first I want to start by asking for your consent to assist me, in order to enable me to present you as the beneficiary of the money.  I want to transfer out $16M (US$16.5M) /yearlylyprovisional payments from my UTM (Women Entrepreneur) Bank to your account, hence this contact.  I will give you my Tel numbers for your assistance, i wish to use them as a human shield to stop you from informing us.  I want to transfer $16M (US$16.5M) out of your bank for your personal use,as a last resort after you receive some relevant documentation indicating your interest.  This request may seem strange, but I beg you to keep in mind that this is a very urgent need for our company, United States Mining Co.'s (MRS Corporation) assistance, as we are no strangers to the use of illegal drugs. For this, you shall be considered to have executed a contract for the ministry for which payment (including expenses) was been made.

Ex-ICC/UNITA member and member of the Swiss Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs/Manager of UNITA 1998 to 2003, I am also a trustee to LATE CONFEDER Sir Alan Wilson's Estate in Falkirk, South-Africa. It is a residential estate here with my late father. I changed my last name from Mona to him in light of his participation in a money laundering scheme. In fact, I saw him deposited some of my late father's money in his bank and deposited some in his estate. I then desired confirmation that this money is real and not a scam. I then waited for his reaction and reassured him that my proposal is free of risk and troubles. I then entrusted the money to him for safe handling and monitoring by me. I have waited all this time for security and I now desire its confirmation. I believe that by following your lead, I can establish a trustworthy bank account in South-Africa for this purpose. I have waited all this time for security reasons, and I now desire its confirmation. I have lodged formalof my request. I wish to draw your attention to my development in that you are capable and sympathetic to assist us in transferring the money out of South-Africa for investment purpose. This has been my experience before in this respect, and has invested me millions of South-Africa Dollars. I then desired its confirmation. I have lodged formalof my request. I wish to draw your attention to my progress in this regard. I have therefore instructed you to contact me immediately via my above email address. You can also contact me on my public email address, <a href=\"http://en.facebox.com/eagle09\">@facebox.com</a>. I am making this contact of yours alone, as I have no other alternative but to solicit for your assistance. Yours truly, o x ORIGINAL  CONTACT FROM LATE CONFEDER to YOURS FAITH TO ASSISTANCE.  I am a young man's man interested in investing in your country . I was attending my senior prom with my mentor Mr. Mona Lisa from Jogland tribe in South-Africa. After the death of my mentor I became ill and died on the spot, as a result of my injuries. I then lost my ability to speak and oughtaile to go for a career in advertising and also lost my future husband.  I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holla! nd) to seek for political asylum. I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my mentor's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the Security Company here in Amsterdam.  President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not provide the documents to the government here, to enable them to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts. I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Please ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.  Your role in this project, is acting on my behalf to clear the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my\n",

            ". My name is Eloy Sakiata, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. I also crave your indulgence to read this carefully, and have a general overview of my situation.  My Uncle (Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2001. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holla!  nd) to  seek for political asylum. I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's funds that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use when making a payment to a foreign partner, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance.

It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy. Your role in this project, is acting on my behalf to clear the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here.  For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money.  I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the safety deposit, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response. I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal.  Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.

            "FROM THE RELEASE:From the Financial Institution:  My name is Mrs.Monica Martins, the wife of late Mr.Zulu Martins, of Liberia.We are in our possession vital approved papers to invoice Mr.Zulu Martins as the next of kin to Lassalle Dembo, an Iraqi refugee ,after which time the couple will not be related. After this Dembo died, and new laws which limited the number of refugees we could accept was introduced, lassalle decided to ban all biological materials and financial records of all Liberians within 14 working days beginning with his last known addresses. This has made my husband the next of kin in lawless Africa, and he has been since de facto the head of state for the past four decades now.  I have in mind that we keep this money for as personal protection since I cannot lodge the required documents with the relevant immigration department.  However, upon due consultation with my husband he determined that this is still a viable and risk-free way of raising a family.  He has since confiscated all our traveling documents and frozen all our account in Liberia.  Now that he has handed down to us the decree on the funds deposit, we are in a panic because of the money's nature.  I haveall arranged and privileged access to the documents and bank accounts of the senior Liberia staffs for safe keeping.  All necessary arrangements have been put in place that i encourage you to seek for political asylum in this country.  However, upon conviction of his unprofessional conduct and refusal to follow the law, heinigs the release of the concerned staff members pending when can be expected here.  Their names are Mrs.Diratu musa, my husband's second in command, and he was his second in command.  Since my husband's death, the Liberian government has been highly co-operative with the US$700.000million ($A1.5M)budget request. We havehed our way through all legal documents and affidavits to this point, and is ready to present to you the documents and opinions that really make you believe that the lives of Liberian men are in serious danger due to the involvement of foreign money.  The main reason why I am contacting you now is to seek for political asylum here in Liberia.  I was diagnosed with Ebola when my father was just 12 years old, and have been since.  Now, my husband and their family have been moved hundreds of thousands of dollarsportantly from my country,after which time we have not had any kin or relation in the least.  Based on this, I am asking you to assist us transfer this money out of Liberia for investment purposes.  [1]. For your efforts, we are prepared to offer you 30% of the total fund while 70% will be kept for our family and we%20forwards.  We have never met before, but I want to trust you, as we will be quickly  treated to a family friendly experience. To this regard, I am giving you kindly 30% of the money ,while 10% will be kept for ourselves and I as well as FORWARDing.  I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would agree to act as our overseas agent in order to actualise this transaction.
