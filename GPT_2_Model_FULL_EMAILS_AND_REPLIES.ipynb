My colleagues and I have been working secretly to move the fund out of our country and get a foreign partner to carry out this big project for us since we don't have any bank account. The transaction involved was a genuine investment in long-term investment for both of us. On completion and verification to our knowledge, this fund has been moved into a safe account overseas where it will be invested again after maturity as a secured and viable investment for both of us by our colleague whose account we are presently at. The transaction itself was concluded without any problem, and the agreement that we reached upon mutual consent and with due respect, we have agreed to execute the agreement ourselves after the transaction is successfully completed.  We will use our positions to secretly move funds out of the whole empire and even the whole former republic to come over to your country, which we will do this in strict confidence and for certain we will accomplish our project successfully.  We are still working on this transaction for our respective positions and we hope you will treat this with utmost co-operation as it is very confidential.  We will call you for a discussion after the facts. If you are not agreeable to this proposal kindly leave us a message.  It will be better if we kept it to a strictly secret according to my colleague because we don't want anyone to know about this deal because we are concerned with this issue myself.

I am elisabeth Chrétien. I am 58 years of age. I am A Resident Child of deceased Husband, Late Dr. Edwin Châtelet. My husband, in fact died of cancer. My late husband, this name, after his numerous chemical works, was poisoned to death early May 1994 by my late colleagues while they were on a visit to your land.  I am a widow to Dr. Edwin Châtelet whose  husband died of cancer, the fact that her late husband did not disclose any of this to the investigators after the death of her husband, made me decide to champion a new kind of charity organisation for my husband.  I am just a 15 years old girl and just made plans to go into business, hoping that something bad would come my way.  However, after years of prayer and effort I decided to contact you for a profitable business proposal, and found you are a man of finance /legal standing. I am contacting you for a partnership that will be beneficial to both of us. I have made several arrangements to get more informations, along with other relevant documents, so that I can send you a copy of the deposit file of my late husband\\'s money, which we discovered to the Bank where we are now waiting to move forward on receiving it. Also, I have made several arrangements to keep this money safe where it will be deposited, in a private house, for our safety, while further investigation and auditing shall confirm everything. The bank and myself are currently in a custody, along with the consignments, in a security company.  The reason I made this proposal to you is to seek a business for my husband while also hoping that your assistance will be considerate when it comes to this important business, which will involve us traveling to your country for the transfer. After the successful completion of this business, you will be given 25% of the total amount, 70% will be for us. All I want for your cooperation is for you to keep this money safe and to invest your money in your country where we shall invest some of our share in the business.

', 'urgent business proposal Dear Sir/CEO I am MISS ELLIS DAVID from South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources. During the current tenure of the former President, I made several series of costly and unsuccessful attempts but all went astray as corrupt officials.  My findings were uncovered by a foreign contractor working with me to  overcharge him with US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty Five Million, Five Hundred  Thousand United States Dollars) to mine abandoned  and defaced headstone  of a major commercial firm.  Though my findings have resonated with all of my colleagues and I set out to find a way to compensate  this money-losing man with an alternative investment or service that can  compensate  him better.  Based on my knowledge base in this country in different industries, we came  across your firm located on the bank lot  that employed one of our new  employees as an offshore consultant/contractor/client, working with Contract Name : DESIGNATED FOR  PROFESSIONAL USE OR (DC NN) CINEMA/CERTIFICATE OF  COMPANY TO COME OVER AND ASSIST  MY MOTHER AND FATHER  TO RECEIVE DIPLOMATIC EXPENSES.  However, my mother and  father died since we have been victims of mosquito  infestations in our country while my  father was in administration of an African country government  Awarding Federal Contract money to a prominent businessman.  My father was a wealthy Gold-  mining magnate, made several bankruptcies in his life and most  of all, he did not manage to cover up his banking  position in my name for the federal government Awarding Federal Contract.  Consequently  my late father gave me a notice to provide him with  the sum of US$25.2 M (Twenty Two Million, Five Hundred Thousand  United States Dollars).  I believe that this money is the bonafide next of  kin to my late father and intend to use it  for investments and to invest in any lucrative  business or industry. It is my duty as an Executive Accountant  and Attorney to ensure that the funds are transfered to the  bank account of a foreigner.  I will take over as foreign account the account  administrator the account for the safety of the deceased and the  safety of the beneficiary .There is currently no risk  to the account.  Your advise and capacity as a person of the art is of  immense interest to me as it may be after considering  the experiences of other African nations who treat foreign clients with  utmost  secrecy and as if the same old suspicion. I have  decided to give you twenty two million  united states dollars as the  ultimate compensation, after which I will arrange for a  telephone  and fax  communications with the beneficiary for the transfer  of the fund.  Accordingly, the banking law and guidelines  that govern the transfer of fund for the bank  is that if such funds as have been transferred  to the bank before my late father's death remain  unclaimed after four years, the amount  transferred will be forfeited to the Bank for  nothing. Therefore, I will like you to provide  immediately the next of kin or relation who should know the  truth about this fund and to obtain a will  bearing the funds for this transaction.  The money will be paid to you for us to share in  the ratio of 50% for me and my family and 35%  for you and me and the balance of Three Million  United States Dollars. If you are interested  in assisting me, please reply immediately via  my email address  so we can proceed with the business.  Upon receipt of your response  I will send to you by fax  mail the text of the will and the  will affidavit which we will use to bind together the  bank account and carry out the business We will have  a whole lotus offering when the money  is paid In your will.

It is my sincere hope that  this request will bring you some assistance which can be interpreted as  assistance in an investment in your country.  I am interested in selling my first melon and should need your  permission to do so in your country. My name is Boris Honi, I am 24 years of age.  My real father was a farmer in the north of Nigeria standing partnership with my  late father. I have since lost my ability to talk and  this has particularly affected me as a result.  My present condition is that of having a hypertension medical treatment and  having recently had my hearing loss diagnosed.  Due to this, I have been suffering from semi brain fog psychosis.  My doctors have told me that I may not last for the next  six months due to brain fog and I really don't want to die  of this illness. The doctors have advised that I have only a  few months to live, and that I need to look for a partner; a life  longer  for himself.  I want to assure you that I have all the medical  aids I need to make this wish come true. The aid here is Ayu'ite  chemical concoction which I mix with my finger and use  to make the base of the melon, which I sell in candies, to mark  as family valuables and to be taken with me by my partner to  the doctor for  subsequent  and informed  dissection.  I want to assure you that I have employed all my  nerve and judgement to make this  wish come true.  Please note that I have made all manner of  front cover  needed in order to disguise the true condition of my  illness.

This is necessary because we Muslims have suffered a lot of harassment in the  wake of the hanging of Quallo Navidad in the republic of Cote D' Ivoire for our assistance.  I depend on your cooperation to guarantee a smooth conclusion of this  business.  I will be expecting your response and will act on this by myself in your letter.  I remain yours truly  Sincerly,  MISS SINCERONE SINCERONE EMAIL: [sincerone@sify.com] ', 'From: Miss Linda Savimbi  EMAIL: humaborbox@yahoo.com  Dear Sir,  Kind regards,  Permit me to inform you of mail that is very urgent. Content-Type: email/ < < ; pls check if it is me or not. This is an urgent response to your question regarding the transfer of   some funds into your nominated account overseas; I am Mr. julzani khalilm ,an officer in my department. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$8.5M (Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with account number 14-2558-5976 that belongs to one of our  foreign customer who did not leave a single writing in the oversea paperwork for his payment in Kenya. On further investigation, I discovered that since the death of the deceased his  account owner has been unable to come forward to claim his share of the total sum.  Therefore, my team and I has already developed a strategy to locate any of our foreign customer who might be used as a next of kin or as the next of kin of the deceased for the transfer although it may sound strange and uncharitable to have a customer whose financial state and soul is so crashy in this case.  I am also revealing to you today that a member of our foreign customer family from the bank where the fund was deposited claim the contents of his account and says that he has just served two years' for a crime he did not commit and cannot be brought forward as next of kin, even though he was the former customer he said was ransicted and mutilated. His next of kin has not been located. The policy of our bank is that any member of our foreign customer's family more than once in our history, including this one, has had its particulars changed or have their assets/properties reported as local properties. This is unfortunate as the Nigerian Attorney/General is well known to be a foreigner who cannot stand a foreigner and a foreigner whose business it is to claim property of any kind. Hence, for the record, in my branch, I discovered on the way in coming in that the manager of Shell Petrofinery has his own delivery house in Nigeria. This is a huge Oil producing community in N. Rivers State that covers much of Plateau county, Southeastern Plateau, River State into the whole country of N.R.R. I need your assistance so that I can2  proceed in claims for my branch and these we will invest heavily in joint venture ventures together with my local partners. And we have other plans which I will share with you. My partners have already done the physical claim, however, we will invest heavily on the Internet and related fields in partnership with you. We plan to have the whole finance/security company assigned to claim the whole amount in their right of domiciliary office in their jurisdiction in the Abidjan & Cote d'Ivoire bound up our behalf.  As it stands, we have produced to the Bank of Abidjan & Cote d'Ivoire all the necessary\n",

This is simple; all you need do is  to approve the transfer on our notice that you will  be responsible for paying any amount as soon as you receive the  fund.  Be forewarned; this is not the first time this kind of  business has happened to me.  This is because I have failed to clear the account over  two years ago. Prior to my death, I cleared the account with  the office of the Director of Foreign Operations and the  account has been dormant in its current condition.  This sum of US$22.5M (Twenty-two Million, Five Hundred  United State Dollars) is still sitting in the  Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at  the end of each year. It has gotten to the point where individuals that have maintained  the same name for over two years now gets rolled over with the principal sum  being equal to one third of what it was worth in the first place. It is not a  problem to have been having expired addresses, expired licenses, expired  property, expired copyrights, etc. It is just that the one that amassing  this money is diverting it through illegal means.  There are two options; either you can choose to accept 35% of  the total sum as compensation for your effort/input after the  money is transferred to your account or you can go into  business  with your life and keep the money for yourself.  The former is better for a while, then the latter are better for  more time.  I believe with the strong opinion of my good friend that you should  not to entertain any atom of fear as all necessary  modalities is in place to ensure a successful transaction.  Furthermore, we have agreed that 50% of this money will be for you  in your name, while 5% will be for all the  harm that come our way.  Please do not expose us for anything if you are not interested  in this deal because we have already concluded our  transaction.  Any suggestions which you may have are highly appreciated.  Best regards,  Mr Henry Kabore\", 'Good Day Dear,  I know you will be surprised at this letter as we only know  who we need to target for a deal, but I will just say that you will be very grateful if you can help me in getting this funds release to you. The arrangement I am using to request for the transfer of this fund is based on a  mutual trust maintained in the emirate,the laws of emirate do not allow for  transfer of money of this nature to any person,so this is how the money is transferred. The money is maintained on account at the emirate or provided by a  foreign partner.The money is transferred in cash and in an economical manner,i will like to  entertain any question from you,but first I need your assistance, I will give you more details about myself and the bank  within an hour via my alternative e-mail address:zevenkamara03@yahoo.com and we will discuss the modalities of the transaction further after. I am inviting you to contact me for further details on how we shall proceed. I await your urgent response,  Thanks and God bless you,  Yours truly,  Mr. Henry Kamara.

This was  because he deposited boxes and  valuables in the embassy, he used the box as his  lodgement's money.  We later learnt that the government and  exile charity organisations in Africa and Asia  who had supported my father were burnt  out or assassinated.

I am writing following an opportunity in my office that could  have major and very lucrative benefits for both parties.  In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 530  million Us dollars (Numbered Twenty Five Million US  Dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who  died along with his entire family in (URGENT LAY   FUND) with other passengers on board the A320 flight of  Air France flight 890 with enroute to Paris  ÉTC.

I have been on this     proposal for some months now ,but as of now it (    not  related to any pending matters that    might arise in the office of Attorney-at-Law or    regional co-operation).I am now convinced that    it is not only a vanity's project that I have   to propose,but that of the firm that will take care of    all other debts owed to me and my firm and also the family that    have been left behind by    Mr.Njobe Ijia  a jibe-sensitive individual  so that it will never get out to the    individual.  And for the family ,it is on this    note that I decided to keep this issue as a  special and top secret because of the sensitive nature of    this issue.  All documents of the Fund are absolutely confidential to    this Firm; it does not matter whether or not you are a    foreigner or a    businessman; I simply inform you that you are to    be  appointed as the claimant/beneficiary of the funds as stated  in our banking guidelines; the funds    to be declared \"INVESTMENT SAFE\" and deposited on your    good good Faith.

Do not contact me if I have not already disclosed the    information on a pending transaction    because I do not want to be bothered    about (i.e you) which is why this email sent to me by the    other  email, contains nothing but    confidential information.

However, if this proposal constitutes the basis for a change of attitude and decision, I will immediately equip you with all the necessary information and documents to enable us see this transaction through. I assure you that this will be most conducive to your interest and my. Engr. benefit as a result of which I will give you all the information needed to effect any transaction in this field.  This transaction, would be foiled by any means legal and appropriate to my purpose, as this would involve the payment of the principal amount of  the deposit to you, and the transfer of the balance to your local account.  I wish to repeat here, as a necessity to convey this message with your full consent and trust, I will absolutely no more allow any of my subordinates into your country to discuss about our mutual benefits or any transaction that might interest them.  This would be a total and utter breach of the trust I placed in you both, and my oath to serve my people. I wish to use this moment to introduce myself to you, I am Mrs.Somali Maryam Abacha,the wife of the late President Jonas Sonderk following the death of my husband three months ago.  I had hoped that the sudden death at the hands of the current Commander-in-chief (JIN) would bring about a change of government and lead to Abba's removal from office, hence my husband's death. But, I underestimated the strength of the Southern Movement which was building up in South Africa, as the President was highly respected in his country, he failed to act on his invitation and step down on the 15th of June. I am convinced that you would do well to exercise due indulgence to come to know and understand that my husband's life is inextricably bound by this document, as there is no other way to end this fatal emergency.  I wish to use this opportunity to inform you that this my husband's condition is very good, and the only thing I have against me is my life, as I want to have a family of my own, and this is how I died, (interrupted) by the Husband, Army General Johannes H. Brown. the only African I know, and very well educated on, who says that he has no knowledge of the War without End any more? Well, I am convinced that you would accept this as true, that the reason I got involved in this business venture is because of my husband, General, because of which I lost my husband 2 years ago.  I am making this proposal because of the financial assistance I will give you when I present you to my people to form a New Zealand National Government. As a result of this financial assistance, which guaranteed my safety and well-being, and which also made me a citizen of New Zealand, I acted on my instinct and made the decisive decision to come to this country to form a new country. I am Mrs.Somali Maryam Abacha,the daughter of the late President Jonas S\n",

I would also like to remind you that this contact is NOT an extradition request,because I am NOT an attorney. This request may seem strange, but I am an ordinary man and you should NOT seek my assistance, EVEN IF you are not his trustee.  Dear Sir,  I offer my services to you in bringing about your acceptance to be contacted by you as his trustee. This proposal  is NOT without its complications.For starters, I am an ordinary man. When I was 10 years old, my father asked my mother to kill me for being gay.

I was under the influence of years of prescription drug abuse and therefore, I was not around to make the request, as I was not capable or particularly interested in handling a huge sum of money. But I did come over to seek his assistance, because I was interested in investing in his country. I have always been interested in business, and I am very interested in investing in your country.  I work with the Union Bank of Angola (UBA), and was one of the negotiators on a particular arms deal between Saudi Arabia and the rebels in Angola who were short dead on the 25th of February, 2002, by the Saudi Army.  I have always been interested in business, and I am very interested in investing in your country.  I want to transfer out $16 million (US$16.5M) a year ($1.6M) of our country's total funds into your account. I will give you my Tel numbers for your good convenience, IGO,so you can  assist me in making the right investment, by contacting you directly, but first I want to start by asking for your consent to assist me, in order to enrage the Saudi government and get the funds transferred into your account.  I first started working with the Saudi National Petroleum Corporation (SNPC) in December 2003, and have been working since.ispentimes since.usually to transfer out the US$16.5M (US$16.5M) a year (Seven Pounds) into your account.  I have always been interested in business, and I am very interested in investing in your country.  I want to transfer out $16.5M (US$16.5M) of your total funds into your account.

I will give you my Tel numbers for your good convenient convenience, but first I want to start by asking for your consent to assist me, in order to enable me to present you as the beneficiary of the money.

I will give you my Tel numbers for your assistance, i wish to use them as a human shield to stop you from informing us.  I want to transfer $16M (US$16.5M) out of your bank for your personal use,as a last resort after you receive some relevant documentation indicating your interest.  This request may seem strange, but I beg you to keep in mind that this is a very urgent need for our company, United States Mining Co.'s (MRS Corporation) assistance, as we are no strangers to the use of illegal drugs.

Ex-ICC/UNITA member and member of the Swiss Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs/Manager of UNITA 1998 to 2003, I am also a trustee to LATE CONFEDER Sir Alan Wilson's Estate in Falkirk, South-Africa. It is a residential estate here with my late father. I changed my last name from Mona to him in light of his participation in a money laundering scheme. In fact, I saw him deposited some of my late father's money in his bank and deposited some in his estate. I then desired confirmation that this money is real and not a scam. I then waited for his reaction and reassured him that my proposal is free of risk and troubles. I then entrusted the money to him for safe handling and monitoring by me. I have waited all this time for security and I now desire its confirmation. I believe that by following your lead, I can establish a trustworthy bank account in South-Africa for this purpose. I have waited all this time for security reasons, and I now desire its confirmation. I have lodged formalof my request. I wish to draw your attention to my development in that you are capable and sympathetic to assist us in transferring the money out of South-Africa for investment purpose. This has been my experience before in this respect, and has invested me millions of South-Africa Dollars. I then desired its confirmation. I have lodged formalof my request. I wish to draw your attention to my progress in this regard. I have therefore instructed you to contact me immediately via my above email address. You can also contact me on my public email address, <a href=\"http://en.facebox.com/eagle09\">@facebox.com</a>. I am making this contact of yours alone, as I have no other alternative but to solicit for your assistance. Yours truly, o x ORIGINAL  CONTACT FROM LATE CONFEDER to YOURS FAITH TO ASSISTANCE.  I am a young man's man interested in investing in your country . I was attending my senior prom with my mentor Mr. Mona Lisa from Jogland tribe in South-Africa. After the death of my mentor I became ill and died on the spot, as a result of my injuries. I then lost my ability to speak and oughtaile to go for a career in advertising and also lost my future husband.  I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holla! nd) to seek for political asylum. I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my mentor's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the Security Company here in Amsterdam.  President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola.

            ". My name is Eloy Sakiata, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. I also crave your indulgence to read this carefully, and have a general overview of my situation.  My Uncle (Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2001. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holla!  nd) to  seek for political asylum. I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's funds that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use when making a payment to a foreign partner, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the Security Company here in Amsterdam.  President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here. I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy. Your role in this project, is acting on my behalf to clear the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here.  For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money.  I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the safety deposit, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response. I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal.  Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.

            "FROM THE RELEASE:From the Financial Institution:  My name is Mrs.Monica Martins, the wife of late Mr.Zulu Martins, of Liberia.We are in our possession vital approved papers to invoice Mr.Zulu Martins as the next of kin to Lassalle Dembo, an Iraqi refugee ,after which time the couple will not be related. After this Dembo died, and new laws which limited the number of refugees we could accept was introduced, lassalle decided to ban all biological materials and financial records of all Liberians within 14 working days beginning with his last known addresses. This has made my husband the next of kin in lawless Africa, and he has been since de facto the head of state for the past four decades now.  I have in mind that we keep this money for as personal protection since I cannot lodge the required documents with the relevant immigration department.  However, upon due consultation with my husband he determined that this is still a viable and risk-free way of raising a family.  He has since confiscated all our traveling documents and frozen all our account in Liberia.  Now that he has handed down to us the decree on the funds deposit, we are in a panic because of the money's nature.  I haveall arranged and privileged access to the documents and bank accounts of the senior Liberia staffs for safe keeping.  All necessary arrangements have been put in place that i encourage you to seek for political asylum in this country.  However, upon conviction of his unprofessional conduct and refusal to follow the law, heinigs the release of the concerned staff members pending when can be expected here.  Their names are Mrs.Diratu musa, my husband's second in command, and he was his second in command.  Since my husband's death, the Liberian government has been highly co-operative with the US$700.000million ($A1.5M)budget request. We havehed our way through all legal documents and affidavits to this point, and is ready to present to you the documents and opinions that really make you believe that the lives of Liberian men are in serious danger due to the involvement of foreign money.  The main reason why I am contacting you now is to seek for political asylum here in Liberia.  I was diagnosed with Ebola when my father was just 12 years old, and have been since.  Now, my husband and their family have been moved hundreds of thousands of dollarsportantly from my country,after which time we have not had any kin or relation in the least.  Based on this, I am asking you to assist us transfer this money out of Liberia for investment purposes.  [1]. For your efforts, we are prepared to offer you 30% of the total fund while 70% will be kept for our family and we%20forwards.  We have never met before, but I want to trust you, as we will be quickly  treated to a family friendly experience. To this regard, I am giving you kindly 30% of the money ,while 10% will be kept for ourselves and I as well as FORWARDing.  I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would agree to act as our overseas agent in order to actualise this transaction. The deal in brief is thatthe funds with which to carry out our proposed investments in your country is presently in a coded account in the Nigerian apex bank and we need your assistance to transfer the funds to your country or any safe account outside your country in a convenient bank account that will be provided by you before we can put the funds into use. For this, you shall be considered to have executed a contract for the ministry. The contract sum of which shall run into US$15.5Million of which your share shall be 30% if you agree to be our overseas agent.  As soon as payment is effected, and the amount mentioned above is successfully transferred into your account, we intend to use o!   ur own share in acquiring some estates abroad. For this too, you shall serve as our agent.  In your role as our agent, you shall serve as our back channel.  To enable the immediate transfer of the funds, and facilitate the process, I shall be asking you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds.  The amount of $15.5Million will be my share and you shall be our overseas agent.

If you're the one who does it, it's better to leave \\nto us all than to destroy one.  As it turns out, it's not so bad after all.  \\nWe had a conversation about this last Wednesday and it only got more and \\ndiscussed over the past three weeks.  I can tell you, of all the things that go \\nguarantaking, that if I were you, and you and Dad, I would make \\nis most of these people happy.  When it comes to my daughter, and her sister, it \\nwould be a lot easier if we all left it to us.  What I just \\nreally wanted to do with\\nin the family was to make things quite easy for our new daughter.  I didn't \\nyou have to make many decisions about how she should live and play \\nthe rest of her life, but I certainly do feel that I have a\\nlife outside of the family.  I do not want her to think that I\\nhad some sort of physical or mental ill that she is responsible for.  I understand  \\nguarantaking.  So I am taking this in stride with great pleasure \\nand honor.\\nThe only downside I have is that my daughter has been getting married to \\nthis man for years now and I think that her mom could be going \\nback and forth with him or other people.\\nI have some serious reservations with my daughter regarding how she \\nshould be treated.  The main point is that if motherhood were \\ncustomary, I think the best way to deal with this issue would be to \\ntreat her in a comfortable way.  The main downside of that would \\ntay her in a hell of a lot of pain and turmoil if she didn't get \\nyou in a position of authority.  I know that the best way to handle this issue \\nthere is to simply acknowledge that she doesn't want to continue to have \\ntmotherhood.\\nThe main downside of this is that it would make me want to be dead \\nin the room for days to come.  I don't want to have to spend time with a \\nman who wants to take my daughter to the funeral.  I can't imagine the \\nattention that the dead person would get from those people.\\nDo you know how many times my daughter had been told that she was going to \\nthe funeral for sure?\\nThe thing about people and other things is that when they are talking about \\ntanything, they get in the way of the very best they can do it for, and we can't \\nauthorize or allow anyone else to take care of her body.  \\nYou know, most people talk about being a part of the family, but they never really \\nbelieve in any of this.  You know how many times we have tried to convince them to \\ngoodo the decision to get into the funeral business, but they were always so \\nfantastic that they ended up trying to convince themselves that something \\namorrowing about the funeral was better than nothing.  Maybe in a \\nfaster-than-all-the-worlds-could-be-this, but what else would happen?  I have \\nnever heard of a person\n",

            " \\nI\\n---------------------- Forwarded by Martin J. Mowry/HOU/ECT on 04/22/2000 \\nAttached is the modified contract included in our February/March 6, 2000 \\nreleases. The revised version contains some changes that would be appropriate for \\ntax/language changes (e.g. we are required to obtain a copy to confirm the \\nexceptions and warranties that have been agreed to). The revised \\nscript and the revised contract include new language regarding the \\ntransaction status of the contract. The revised form of contract contains \\nspecific changes that have not been incorporated in any written contract. In our view, \\nthe changed terms would make the revised version more comprehensive and the \\npreliminary language more specific. This was the change we would like to make (but were \\nexecuted in February of 1999). Therefore, in order for the revised contract to \\ndefine confidentiality and ensure all parties have a copy of the contract, \\nall parties would need to be on the same side of the agreement and have a signed \\nDocument of Confidentiality Agreement in each party's hand. The revised version\\nto incorporate these changes should make the revision effective by March 6.  Please review the attached \\ncontract and make any necessary changes.  \\nPlease advise that our contract is subject to change before February 6 as we \\nare now requesting changes to the original contract for clarity.\\nIf you have any concerns regarding the original contract, please contact \\nwe at 713-546-7307.
