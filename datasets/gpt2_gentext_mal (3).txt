My name is Mr. Melvin Samson I work as an accountant in a bank; I contacted  you to work together with me in claiming my late client's estate.  Unfortunately he died without a registered next of kin and as such the funds  now have an open beneficiary status. You could be made the beneficiary since  you share the same last name with him. This has officially transferred the right to you, as no other person from  his family knows anything about this fund with our bank.If you are  interested in working with me, please get back to me as quickly as possible so that I give you the details  of what we are to  do. I wait for your prompt response so that I can give  you more briefing of what you need to and how to do it. Thanks for your co-operation.

The United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) has decided to officially discontinue support for Al-Qaeda in Iraq and Syria (AQ   Nusra) in favour of arms sales to Europe.  The decision by the party to withdraw its ambassador to Europe comes as a surprise as we had been trying to locate a reliable foreign partner for a very long time now.  However, an arrangement was concluded between us in 2003 which made it possible for us to move the consignment to a safer country where there is less risk of attack from foreign fighters.  Since then, we have not had any fatal injuries or illnesses on account of the arrangement we have made with the foreign partner, as a whole.  However, since the death of my husband, Muhammed, in a terrorist attack in my country, as a result of which he had to be evacuated to a safer country,  he was given a ceremonial burial near the town where he died, leaving no one to trace.

My Dear Friend,  I am  J.T. MARTINS Dear Sir,  I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates and  share in the process. The present situation in the South African economy has  made it very difficult for me to make investments and in some cases even murder my colleagues in view of this.  Fortunately, I was able to move out from Johannesburg,  capital of South Africa, here on a business venture by Mr.Kola Daniel.  I have since made several unsuccessful attempts to reach him, but he has not yet replied.  I therefore contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my client before it is confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this deposit was lodged.  Particularly, the bank where this deposit was lodged has issued me a notice to provide the Next of Kin or have the funds confiscated within 14 working days.  Since then, my share of the money has stayed with me
