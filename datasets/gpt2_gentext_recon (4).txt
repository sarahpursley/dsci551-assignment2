At the expiration of 5 (five) years, such funds will revert to the ownership of  the Government for financing military operations, such as purchasing of arms and ammunitions  for the military.

The deceased CEO of Algosaibi Oil Company had a turnover of US$35.5M (FIFTEEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) when this fund was approved for transfer to the account of his  Investors.  This was because the fund has been dormant in his account with the Government without any  claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before the transfer.
