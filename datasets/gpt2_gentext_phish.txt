A resident of Thailand, I have urgent and confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1998, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the Thailand Mining and Petrochemical Corporation, Mr. Frank Davison made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$24,500,00 (TEN MILLION, UNITED STATES DOLLARS) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.\nAfter a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the United State Department of Commerce that Mr. Frank Davison died from an automobile accident.\nOn further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Frank Davison did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$24 million, lodged in a rolled deposit account with my Bank, has been dormant there. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Thailand Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the owner of the funds deposit to reflect your particular personality. I need your strong assurance and honesty to enable me transfer the money to your country for investment. I have the power and the leverage to get the money transferred to your account within 5-7 working days.\nA bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% to you.\nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the lawyer and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On June 6th,1997,a\nforeign Oil consultant/contractor with the German Marshall Fund,Mr.Eric Bello\nMark, made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at\nUS$15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million Dollars) in my branch.I sent a routine notification to\nhis forwarding address but got no reply.\nAfter a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his\ncontract employers,the German Marshall Fund that Mr.Eric BelloMark\nMark died in an auto accident on 25th July,1998 in a sudden\noverweight state in Accra-Ghana and the bank has since been\nrecovered from the \ndeath of the previous owner of the account.\nNo trace of Mr.Eric BelloMark's next of kin has been discovered.\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now seek your \npermission to have you stand as a relative of the deceased because the\nbank have issued me a notice to provide his next of kin or \nleave the account.\nUpon this discovery,the bank has moved the matter to the\nconcordinating authority of the bank where it is being  watched \nfor a foreign partner to take over the\naccounts of which we shall be beneficiary.\nI am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate an\naccount here like this.So I want you to be the next of kin of the deceased so\nthat the proceeds of this account valued at US$15million dollars\nwill be paid to you and then we can share the fund.\nThe bank shall be fully aware of this account and any arrangement\nforsharing the fund\nshall be duly decided by both parties.I want you to be the\nforeign partner to facilitate the sharing of the fund.\nThereafter,we shall be in receipt of your services to\ninvoice the deposit on the account as the branch domiciliary and\nforward your name as foreign partner or foreign direct or your\ncompany name as a local partner to be the next of kin of the deceased

The reason why we have kept this confidential is as we cannot release the fund to you unless formally charged as the next of kin to the deceased.\r\nWe have agreed to share the fund among ourselves.\r\nThis transaction is 100% safe and risk free. This is because we have put in place the neccesary machinery to reliably locate the next of kin and to make sure that the fund remains unclaimed till the account owner applies to own account as the next of kin of the deceased.\r\nThe transaction would be completed with the approval of the president of the republic of republic of Benin and the certificate of deposit of the fund in a restricted account.\r\nThere after I and a few other officials from our Civil Service would visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.\r\nThis money has been with our bank for a long time but only recently started to show signs of life. As the world watched closely with keen interest, we decided to make this business proposal to you and release the fund to you as the next of kin of the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since the modalities for transfering this fund to you is the same as that for purchase of new machinery and materials for the farms and establishment of new farms in Benin and other Benin.\r\nThere is a tax of 4pc per tonne of fund which you have to remit by telegraphic transfer to avoid being wilfully out of tune with your country's spirit of entrepreneurship.\r\nWe have also put in place a good machinery and inspection certificate office in Benin and will ensure that the fund is marked "REMITTANCE DURING PERIOD" so that the money will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.\r\nI am the only person in my office and position that can give us a sense of the power involved in this transaction. I will give you 25% of the total amount for your assistance, and 60% for me. Thereafter, you will phone me on my private phone number +234465362164 and inform me in your best interest to invest the money in real estate.\r\nI remain assuring you that this transaction is 100% risk free and there will be

U.S and Iraqi forces clash in the first month of this year, killing some 2,000 Iraqis and wounding another some 18,000 in the year to date. Most of the dead are in the country where the fighting began, where few people live and where many civilian homes and properties have been destroyed. The fighting in Iraq started as a result of a chemical attack by the Iraqi government on innocent civilians, and has since led to many civilian deaths. Authorities have been accused of acting like the "War Criminals" and killing innocent people. What bothers me most is the rampant looting, which covers all types of Local, National and International properties, including Market and Residential Properties. The situation is getting so bad that my cousin and I have decided to move this fund to a good Country with good Government Officials and good Investment Opportunities for our Young Men.I have already invested the money in real estate and want to invest it in Real Estate with Real Estate Companies that will help me with Investment Opportunities. Unfortunately, all I can do is sit on it and watch as the Money is kept in Escrow and the money is kept in instruments that will allow me to Transfer it to your Country. I have also decided to move this fund to a Foreign Country because I don't want to be exposed by the Local Government as some officials of this Government are not Strong on Religion and may not like my treatment in the Country. The situation in Iraq is quite different. The Government seems to be very strict with Local Government, which is why I am contacting you, I am seeking your assistance to help me and my family receive this money so that we can invest it on Real Estate with Real Estate Companies that will help us find a good Account with a good Investment Opportunity.\n In order to transfer this money to any country where it will be safe, I will want you to give me your Telephone Number, Your Age and Position so that the lawyer can come and sign the documents to change your Telephone number and Position so that he/she can give you the Change.\nI will want you to come to this Country to have the Account transferred, I will want you and your family to stand as one of the Beneficiary of this fund. \nSo, you must give me the following information to change your Telephone number and Position so that the lawyer can give you the Change

I am 44 years old and I work with a small business here in London, UK. In an account that was opened in my company by a foreigner, who also died since 8 years ago. The account has no other beneficiary and my money is being kept in British Pounds Sterling. The reason for the freezing of the account is because the owner of the account died since 8 years ago.\r\nMeanwhile, the payee is paying the taxes as they never bothered to go through the documentation to get this money. Since we have not had any death or any other misfortune since his death, the payee is paying the taxes as they always do, and we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts.\r\nIt is against this background that I moved this fund from London UK to other London UK to seek for a better life and to better my country while I was still alive.\r\nSince my move to London UK, the payee in question has no other beneficiary and my money is being kept in British Pounds Sterling.\r\nMeanwhile, the payees in other than the UK and this is a total mystery to me.\r\nI am seeking your help to come forward and claim this fund so that you and the company can be paid this money back to your country.

What was your marital status before joining the Iraq war?\nMy late father was among those killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home. Now my situation is no more. I am now seeking for a foreigner to take me as a foreigner into trust to facilitate the disbursement of my father\'s funds in proper trust and confidence. The money was originally gotten from my father\'s estate. My late father was compensated withmint worth\nTwenty Four million Five hundred thousand Dollars ($28,000,000.00 USD) which he deposited in a Barracks in west Africa. The money was deposited in a box to avoid much demurrage from the security company who confiscated the money for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you.\nThe money has been with my father since the war started and it has not been dormant for me. There is no way he can cheat on his death in the air crash that hit their home. The money is in an underground safe. I am willing to give you 1% for your assistance to facilitate the disbursement of this fund in your country. I will also send my children to school to earn my share. I am afraid of foreigners as I am a foreigner too and I don’t want to travel and make any money. The money will be paid into a security deposit account in your country. I want you to be the one to supervise the money transfer to a foreign Account and be sure to never be in any kind of trouble. I will also let you know when the money is finally transferred to your account. This is the only way this money will be misused.\nDue to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to effect the transfer smoothly and with assurance. I am willing to give you 30% of the total sum, 60% for me and 10% for any expenses that may be incurred in the course of the business. See the email below to enable you send the link to the person. Upon your response, I shall then come over to your country and speak with you at the cost of 20%.\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you get this email.\nBest Regards,\nMRS ALI KABI\n.\n   http

He also accused me of indulging in fraud as a foreigner and he also accused me of seeking for asylum in return for my services.

I am James Garour, the son of late minister Dr Robert Garour who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I have contacted you to assist in repartrating the money left behind by my late father before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposit was lodged.\nAs the Minister of State for Minerals and Energy, I have the mandate of my position and the mandate of my family. To the surprise of nobody, I stumbled upon this site through the efforts of some colleagues of mine. What disturbs me most is that the account opened by my late father has been dormant since the last serious disturbance has occured in his family. This I know will not bode well for the security of my family. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such deposit remains dormant for any length of time, the money will be transferred into the treasury as unclaimed funds. Hence the reason for contacting you.\nI have contacted you to assist in repartrating the money left behind by my late father before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposit was lodged. And I am not the only person on this confidential business, you are also the sole beneficiary of the contract sum which was signed on behalf of my late father by me. You will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as compensation, 5% for expenses as a result of not being involved in the matter, while the remaining 60% will be your own share to enable us execute a transaction of this nature. This transaction has nothing to do with the contract awarded to me by my late father. It is about trust and transparency, and I am ready to do business with you in any medium of our choice, you can contact me in this email:jamesgarour3@yahoo.com.hk\nI am willing to give 25% of the total sum to you for your understanding and co-operation, while 10% will be set adrift for any expenses whatsoever you may incure during the business transaction.\nI have all necessary legal documents to back up my claims against my former side. I feel very privileged to have been able to get this transaction started. All I need from you is your honest cooperation to enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee that this will be

My father was killed along with his family in the air crash of  Kuwait Airways Boeing 727 bound for Kuwait.  The crashed plane was a private jet, and the widow was the only person on board. The Boeing 727 crashed in the Atlantic Ocean. More so, the owner of the plane was among the few passengers on board, and his body was never discovered. The family has been claiming that the girl he was with died since her death, and nobody knows about this. As a result of this, the family has been contorting the whole documents to try and track the family, which is very difficult as everyones information is being kept in a closed and secret nature to avoid anybody's knowledge. \nThe family has also been writting for the Supreme Court of Iraq to open an inquiry into this the results of which is pending.

My name is Mr.Ronald Kinzie, I am the personal aid to the Lieutenant Governor of one of the major oil exporters in the Republic of Liberia, Sierra Leone. However, after the fatal poison that occurred in my country a year before, we were told to go to the nearest country where we can get our own share, but some corrupt government officials told us that we will need to do business with the government of Liberia. So, in the past, I have been the personal aid to the Lieutenant Governor of some oil exporters in the Republic of Liberia, Sierra Leone . However, because of the instability in Liberia, you cannot go to the country to buy oil, but to export it to Africa, where we can invest. Since the death of my father, I have fled, to this country, where I have lived for six years, to a country designated for investment and development. The Ministry of Finance are not aware of this, so they are not aware of this business. So they are not even aware of this business. I have been hoping that the Government of Liberia will let me go because of my family's situation. But they did not want me to go to Liberia because of my family's situation. The business is illegal, and the Minister of Finance are not aware of it. So we have been waiting for the Ministry of Finance to let me go. Unfortunately, they have not told us where we are going. Before the death of my father, he told me he came to Liberia to buy oil, and I can only report the money to the Government of Liberia for that reason. We have decided not to go to Liberia and I need a foreigner to invest it with. The money will be shared among ourselves, so I will like you to stand as the owner of the fund so that the money can be transferred to youself. I will like you to keep the account as confidential as possible. I have all necessary legal documents with me that can be used to back up any claim we may make. I want you to stay as far as I am concerned, we have agreed that you will keep the account secret, because I will need it for now to re-establish contact and get me transferred. I will also want you to come down to Liberia and have a talk with some of the officials. We have agreed that you will not

This money has accumulated a good deal in the sum of $12million dollars. \r\nThe government of Nigeria has ordered the company to settle down and to invest in new and lucrative areas of growth, which is profitable to both of us. The money in this account is for buying properties of which you can be the owner of the properties. \r\nThe money in this account is the result of over-invoiced contracts and expenses which the company incurred in the day of the beheadings. One of the reasons for the sudden increase in expenses incurred by both of us in the case of this account is the total money which is accumulated in the day of the beheadings. \r\nI am contacting you because I believe that you are capable and willing to assist us to move this money out of this country estimated to be US$21million dollars. I need your assistance to move this money out of this country. I have the authority of my family to order the foreign partners to deal with us because of our position in the government of Nigeria. This is the main reason why I need your assistance and co-operation. \r\nI will fine tune the details with the right people

I am Ezeu Guevara, the Mr Chief Auditor of the Reserve Bank of South-Africa (RBSA).I have an urgent and confidential business proposition for you.On June 6, 1999, a gold merchant/ contractor with the South African Mining Corporation, Mr. Paul B. Stevens made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve (12) calendar months, valued at US$9,500,000.00 (Nine Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in the Reserve Bank of South-Africa (RBSA).Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining Corporation that Mr. Paul Stevens died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Paul Stevens did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$9,500,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I want South African banks to provide an account where the money will be transferred without the need for any\r\nresident or family to do it.\r\nThe banking law of my bank dictates that if such money\r\nremained unclaimed after five(5) years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.\r\nThe request of a foreigner as a foreigner is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as second-in-next-last-in-last-in-last-in-last in estate. I am seeking your consent to present you as the next-of-kin of the deceased because you are a foreigner and there is no way I can facilitate the transfer of this money to a foreigner who is not my relative.\r\nThe money will be

Europe is in serious financial crisis, so as a result of this, some European countries in particular Switzerland and Holland have introduced laws and regulations to deal with this problem. But the basic legal framework governing the legality and enforceability of these laws and regulations has not been laid down in place by the federal government yet, the states of West Germany and Netherlands have both legalized medical or other forms of legalized drugs to treat brain damage caused by illegal drugs. Consequently, these countries have banned or restricted the importation of any drug owned or controlled by the federal government. Meanwhile, some European countries have outright refused to sign or operate bank accounts of any of the above mentioned countries. Now, the situation in these countries is getting very political, as President Charles Taylor of the Netherlands recently made a public announcement about his intention to seek the presidency of the Netherlands, which he did, and immediately after, he was challenged by the presidency for the first time in his presidency. This has caused the federal government in Switzerland to declare the Netherlands a Republic of laws and order, and also frozen all Swiss accounts and Depositors' Funds deposited on behalf of Mr.Charles Taylor, since he has been in office. Due to this, I and many in the federal government have decided to make this businness effort to withdraw or suspend all payments to or onward payments to or onward payments to any of the above mentioned parties, but it has proved utterly unsuccessful.\n In view of this, I and some in the federal government are seeking for your assistance in repatriating or finding a new home in which you can establish a reliable and profitable business for which we will pay you.\n We have the power to transfer these funds to any of the above listed banks in your country without any problem either now or in future since we have the authority and the capability to transfer these funds without any hitch either now or in future.\n With this in mind, we have agreed that the money be paid to you in the form of Dinar (inorganizational payment) which will be provided by the federal government to you in respect of assistance and payment of the fund.\n Thereafter, we intend to apply for the necessary beneficiary/next of kin/beneficiary in your country for the transfer of the fund into your account, hence we have agreed that the funds be paid to you in the form of an

Greeting from \r\nMr. Vincent Saine. I am a member of the ECOBANK OF SOUTH AFRICA ( ECOBANK OF SOUTH AFRICA). I have an urgent and confidential business proposition for you.\r\nOn June 6, 1999, a consultant/contractor with the South African Development Bank, Mr. David Ryan made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$45,000,000.00 (FIFTEEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.\r\nAfter a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the South African Development Bank that Mr. David Ryan died in a plane crash. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ryan did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.\r\nThis sum of US$45,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody  applies to claim the fund.\r\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. David  Ryan so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter  of probate administration in your favour for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then

God bless you & God bless you.\nMRS. MARIA MOHAMMED \nSince the death of my late father, he has used to visit my relatives monthly to buy food items, the sum of $9,500,000.00 were deposited in a security company vault in my country for safekeeping, but I got the information about his death from a reliable person in my country who was present when my late father was murdered.\nNow, I am very worried about my family in general. I want to relocate my family to a foreign country or to where they can utilize the funds for investment purposes.\nCurrently, I have been unsuccessful in locating any of my relatives. Now I want to relocate my family to the UAE or any of the countries I can get assistance from and where they can use the funds.\nI have agreed with the security company that I will give 10% of the total money to you for your assistance, in case you are interested and need additional assistance, as the security company will provide me with all the necessary information as soon as I get a reliable and trustworthy person to assist me. \nI have contacted the security company with information as to your country of origin to move the fund out for investment purposes. I want you to proceed with utmost secrecy as to avoid any scandal or embarrassment from my family and I am ready to give you all information into your possible support and involvement in this transaction.\nAll I do is to keep the utmost secrecy, I am hopeful of your quick response and I will avail myself of every opportunity to speak your language, get your ID card number for a foreigner and get your drivers license number for a foreign company. I have set up an operation to move the money unclaimed through banking system, I want you to be the first to know about this transaction so that the people involved will pay all the interest and all that and bring the fund to your country for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. I will lodge this claim with the relevant ministries and foreign exchange departments for final approval of the transaction in your favor by the security company.

Gary Coleman, an American, was murdered in cold blood by his countrymen for refusing to assist him as his supposed next of kin, the Nigerian National Army (ONAF). Presently, this same people has continued to make false statements and defamatory information about me, my family and myself in order to force us to assist them. This is because they (the Nigerian National Army) are not allowed by law of the land to operate bank outside our country. This is the main reason why they decided to make everything to get us for free. At the expiration of (three)years, we have been given (US$11,500,000.00) to live on on as our own. The money, which we have been freezing, freezing, freezing, freezing for the past five years now is in the Reserve Bank of South Africa (Raba), awaiting other transfer of funds to our account.This is because they (the Nigerian National Army) are not allowed by law of the land to operate bank outside our country. Hence, we are not allowed to operate bank outside our country. It is against this background that my father (Gary Coleman) and some of my brothers and sisters now want to transfer the money (US$11,500,000.00) into (South African) account abroad.I and my brothers and sisters are facing many charges and imprisonment, which some of us have been fighting. I have decided to give in and fight for my survival because of the situation here. I am not afraid and this is why I have decided to go for it. I need your strong support, trust and honesty. I am contacting you now because of the need to go on this strong and political campaign. I have decided to seek an attorney who will be able to help me in repatriating the money (US$12.5 Million) which my father (Gary Coleman) and myself are claiming as our own. The money (US$12.5 Million) belongs to a deceased person, who used to work with the South Africa Mining Corporation (S.S.C.). Before his death, he was the Director of Contractors' Workforce Development. You can verify this from the websites below:\n1. http://www.sbnate.com/news/2003/02/15/095972.asp\n

I want to start by contacting you personally on this urgent and confidential matter concerning which I am the only person who knows about this matter and I do not intend to disclose the actual reason of the desire to you.\nOn the 21st of January 2001, an American Oil Consultant with the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$20,500,000.00 (Twenty- eight Million Dollars )in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.\nAfter a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources that Mr. John B. Edwards, a Contractor with the Ministry, died on the 21st of January 2002 in a plane crash. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. John B. Edwards did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my Bank. The said deposit is a huge Sum of US$20M (Twenty Million, Five Hundred and Thirty Thosand United States Dollars). \nUpon this discovery, I now seek your consent to have you stand as one of his relatives so that the money can be moved out of the Republic.\nI have secretly been communicating with his lawyer so that his potential next of kin can receive this money. And also to transfer this money out of my bank as soon as necessary. I want you to be his next of kin so that the money can be moved out of the Republic.I will pay all the legal bills and expenses involved in this transaction. I assure you that this money will be ready to move within ten to fourteen working days. I hope to conclude this transaction within ten to fourteen working days. \nI shall be in a position to make the documents and transfer out within the next fourteen working days. You can reach me on my private telephone number 00229-762-4220-90. I shall be compensating you with 15% of the total sum after the transfer. I need your full co-operation to make this work as successfully as I have stated it can be concluded within fourteen

On the 6th of June 1998, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the British Petroleum Corporation Mr. David Johnson made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$20,000,000.00 (Twenty-One Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.\nAfter a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Petroleum Corporation that Mr.David Johnson died in an Egyptian Air Plane crash disaster along with his wife and only daughter.\nOn further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.David Johnson did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. \nAccording to Laws of Thailand, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. \nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the Next of Kin to Mr. David Johnson so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. This is simple.\n1. I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the next of kin.\n2.You will also need to be physically present in Egypt, Iraq, Liberia, Nigeria, Sudan, your Country of origin and your Foreigners Passport Number so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary papers and will prepare the necessary documents in your name to stand in as the next of kin.\n3.You will also need to be Account Holder in your country so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents to put you in place as the next of kin.\nWe shall employ the service of two attorneys for the drafting and notarization of
