This is a very confidential business proposition that I believe you will  come up short.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $12.5million US Dollars in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family along with his entire family on Monday, 31 July, 2000 in an  EgyptAir Flight 990. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money  because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane  crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this  business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody

Shortly after the death of my father, he instructed me to look for a reliable and honest person who would assist me in this transaction by promising me a safe account abroad where I could transfer the money and furnish me with safe-keeping funds, which I shall use to purchase a house and deposit the money in, which I shall use to invest it abroad. I am seeking your assistance because I do not want to make any mistake, for the money in question was deposited with a Security Company Abroad. Please show your willingness by providing me with your full names, telephone and fax numbers so that I can commence communication with you. I want you to send me your full name, your current residential address and Tel/ Fax numbers. I will furnish you with the details of the transfer. I do not want any risk if you find any. I expect your urgent response through my direct email: mr_matthew_w_s_matters@yahoo.co.uk, as i

I am contacting you on behalf of a client who was killed in a plane crash. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that he did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Senegal, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Senegalias if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.John Doe so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.
