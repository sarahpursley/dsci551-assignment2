['I Need Your Assistance. Dear sir,  It is with a heart full of hope that I write to seek your help in respect of the context below. I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest (heart attack) while on the seat of power.  I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody (for safety) the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern.  This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit; the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband\'s properties is under the authority of the family\'s lawyer Tony Musa.  My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husband\'s wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the "Personal will" of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr!  iends of ours should be used; as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire.  The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this "SOS" call to save my children and I from a hopeless future.  I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims.  The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims.  Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction.  Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email: tony_m@lawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him (my Attorney) on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception.  I look forward to your quick response.  Best Wishes,  Mrs. Maryam Abacha ', 'URGENT BUSINESS PRPOSAL FROM: WILLIAM DRALLO. CONFIDENTIAL TEL: 233-24-204567.

I am Dr.Sam Jordan, the  Manager of headquarter First Bank of Nigeria Plc. Lagos. I have an urgent and confidentialbusiness proposal for you.  On June 6, 1998, an Italian oil consultant/contractor with via National Petroleum cooperation (NNPC) Mr. Paul Bush made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calenderer month valued at US$43.7,000.00 in my branch. On maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarded address but got no reply after months we send a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employee (Nigeria national petroleum Corporation) that Mr. Paul Bush died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, it was clear  that he died without making a will. All attempts by the Australian to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Paul Bush did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his deposit document in my bank. The total sum US$43.7,000,000.00 is still in my bank as dormant acct. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian banking law, after five years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government. If the account owner is certified death and nobody comes forward to claim it. This is the situation , and my proposal is that I am looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the beneficiary/next of kin. This is simple. All you have to do is to immediately send me the details of a bank account anywhere in the world for me to arrange the proper money transfer document. The money will then be transferred into the account for us to share in the ration of 60% for me 30% for you while the remaining 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred with here and there.

I am a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract Award and  Monitoring Committee in the Nigeria National Petroleum  Corporatio(NNPC). Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign  firm in NNPC by my Committee. This contract was over invoiced to the  tune of US$21.5M. U.S. Dollars. This was done deliberately. The  over-invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the  project. We now want to transfer this money which is in a suspense  Account with NNPC into any Overseas Account which we expect you to  provide for us.  SHARE: -  For providing the account where we shall remit the money into, you  will be entitled to 30% of the money,60% will be for me andmy  partners while 10% has been mapped out from the total sum to cover  any expenses that maybe incurred by us during the course of this  transfer,both locally and international expenses.  I would require the following: -  . Your company's name,address,telephone and fax numbers.  The above information would be used to make formal applications as a  matter of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer  to your account.  It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects  of this nature described here. The assumption is that your company  won the major contract and subcontracted it out to other companies.  More often than not,big trading companies or firms of unrelated  fields win major contracts and subcontracts to more specialized firms  for execution of such contracts.  We have strong reliable connections and contacts at the Central Bank  of Nigeria, as well as the Federal Ministry of Finance and we have no  doubt that all the money will be released and transferred if we get  the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal.  Therefore,when the business is successfully concluded we shall  through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the  concerned Government Ministries for 100% security.  We are ordinary civil servants and we will not want to miss this once  in a lifetime opportunity to get rich. We want this money to be  transferred to the overseas Accounts for us, before the present  Democratic Government start Auditing all Federal Government owned  Parastatals.  Please contact me immediately through my telephone number whether or  not you are interested in this deal.If you are not,it will enable me  scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal. Butwhere  you are interested,send the required documents aforementioned herein  through my above telephone number,or  email:edema_ma@mauimail.com,because time is of the essence in this  business.  I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Ministry of Defence headquater in Abuja that Mr. Roger Berget died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin to date has fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Roger Berget did not declare any kin or relations in!  all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$8,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Roger Berget so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names, address, telephone and fax numers so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for drafting and not! arization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your nominated account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% to cover any accidental expenses on either sides during the course of this transaction. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via this email address. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction better. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transactio! n would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

Kabila of Democratic Republic of  Congo (DRC).  Consequent upon the assassination of my husband, I am  in possession of USD 58,000,000 (Fifty Eight Million  US Dollars Only) being funds earlier earmarked for  special projects.  This fund has since been deposited  in a security company in West African Country of Togo  where I am residing now with my children. It is now my intention to move the said fund out of  this place (Togo) to a safer place for the benefit of  my children and I, for immediate investment.  Based on  this that I solicited for your assistance to enable me  take this money out of Togo.  However, note that my children and I have agreed to give you 20% of the total fund if you can accept the  offer of assisting us.  Also it will be your  responsibility in directing us on a viable business.  It is also my intention to relocate and probably take  a temporarily resident in your country pending when  all the troubles in my country will be resolved. We  advised that you look for a house we will buy as soon  as we arrived.  To conclude this transaction, you will be required to  come to Togo to open an account in any bank here in  Togo where the security company will deposit the total  sum in your favor. From this bank the money will be  remitted into your original bank in your country.  Immediately this done, all of us will depart Togo to  your country, where my children and I are expected to  take a temporary resident.

I need the effectiveness of your professionalism in accomplishing this very business. I am DR. MOHAMMED BELLO Director/coordinator Forex and computer operations department of the Afex Bank of Africa PLC.  I am writing this letter to ask your support and cooperation to carry out this business opportunity in my department.  We discovered an abandoned sum of $42.500,000.00 (forty two million, Five hundred thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our customer in Afex Bank of Nigeria, Late Monsieur. Ives Laurent (a French citizen and an Engineer executing major Federal contract with governments of West African sub region). He died with a fellow business associate in a ghastly auto crash last October and his remains have since been incarcerated. Since his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and put claims as the next of kin and beneficiary to the resources in Monsieur. Ives Laurent account, for it is against the ethics and norms of the finance institution to claim such resources without a beneficiary unless proclaimed by the government. The federal government of Nigeria has given directives to finance institutions to declare adamant accounts that has stayed more than 8months in their custody as they intend to use it to pay off her military peace keeping force (ECOMOG) who fought in War ravaged African countries precisely and as the case may be, Late Monsieur. Ives Laurent account fell into this category thus the necessity for contacting you for I am determined to move this fund out as the rigorous and rash economic decision and policies has really turned we government workers to mere civil laborers. I have worked for almost a decade and half and I have nothing to show as reaps and rewards of my hard earned labor.         As I need a next of kin/beneficiary and financial assistance to re-claim this resources for I cannot take on this project alone. My attorney and I have propose a commission of 25% out of the total resources for your kind assistance and five 5% has been mapped out to be reimbursed to both parties as sundry expenses incurred in the course of this business. To commence this transaction, I require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return correspondence to this fax number 234-9-2726223 and enclose your private contact telephone number, fax number, full name & address, and your designated bank coordinates to enable us file a letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer could be made.

THIS IS NECESSITATED BY MY URGENT NEED TO REACH A DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTWORTHY FOREIGN PARTNER. THIS REQUEST MAY SEEM STRANGE AND UNSOLICITED BUT I CRAVE YOUR INDULGENCE AND PRAY THAT YOU TAKE MY REQUEST VERY SERIOUS. I AM MR PETER WILLIAMS, A REKNOWNED BUSINESSMAN IN ONE OF THE REBEL-HELD TOWNS, BOUAKE (ONE OF THE WAR ZONES IN IVORY COAST) I RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM A RELIABLE SOURCE WHO DESCRIBED YOUR COUNTRY AS BEING ECONOMICALLY CONDUCIVE FOR INVESTMENT AND HER PEOPLE AS TRANSPARENT AND TRUSTWORTHY TO ENGAGING BUSINESS WHICH MADE ME TO WRITE YOU. AS YOU MAY WANT TO KNOW AND TO MAKE YOU LESS CURIOUS,I GOT YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS FROM AN INTERNET SITE THAT PORTRAYED YOU (YOUR ESTABLISHMENT) IN GOOD LIGHT. ON THE 17TH OF SEPTEMBER 2002. THE REBEL LEADERS, UNTIL THEN WERE LOYAL SOLDIERS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT LAURENT GBAGBO  CONTACTED ME IN MY OFFICE WITH THE BUSINESS OF IMPORTATION OF ARMOURIES. WITHOUT THE PREMONITION OF WAR, I ACCEPTED THE JOB. THE SOLDIERS PAID ME THE SUM OF TWENTY MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$ 20.5) ON THE SPOT AND TOLD ME TO EXPEDITE ACTION. SINCE I AM NOT INTO IMPORTATION OF ARMUNITIONS AND BECAUSE OF THE URGENCY, I IMMEDIATELY STARTED MAKING SEVERAL CONTACTS WITH BUSINESSMEN ACROSS THE GLOBE. TWO DAYS LATER, HEAVY FIGHTING BROKE UP IN CENTRAL BAOUKE AND KORHOGO, EVERYWHERE WAS IN DISSARRAY AND I LOST EVERYTHING THAT TOOK ME SO MANY YEARS TO ACQUIRE. I HAVE NO OPTION THAN TO DO AWAY WITH THE US$20.5M. MY WIFE AND I QUICKLY MADE AN ARRANGEMENT WITH A RED CROSS RELIEF WORKER WHO USED HIS OFFICIAL VAN TO MOVE THIS MONEY TO ABIDJAN, ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW THE REAL CONTENT OF THE BOX.  PRESENTLY, THIS FUND HAS BEEN DEPOSITED WITH A SAFE RELIABLE SECURITY COMPANY IN ABIDJAN WHERE I AM HIDING FROM THE REBEL WHO DECLEARED ME WANTED. I DO NOT WANT TO INVEST THIS MONEY IN ABIDJAN DUE TO UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC CLIMATE.  AS A RESULT, I KEPT THE MONEY IN A CUSTOM BONDED WAREHOUSE WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY.  SO THAT I CAN NOT LAY MY HANDS ON IT UNTIL IT GETS TO YOUR COUNTRY, WHERE I WILL COMMENCE INVESTMENT. THE ONLY ASSISTANCE WE NEED FROM YOU WHICH I BELIEVE YOU WOULD DO FOR US ARE THE FOLLOWING: 1. MAKE IMMEDIATE ARRANGEMENT TO TAKE THE DELIVERY OF THE CRATE (FUND) AT THEIR EUROPE OR AMERICAN COMMISSION AGENTS. 2. ASSURANCE FROM YOU THAT YOU WILL NOT SIT ON OUR SHARE WHEN THIS FUND GETS TO YOUR COUNTRY.

EMAIL:   williamsd1@rediff.com Dear Friend, SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I will crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is MR WILLIAMS DANIEL of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace. Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately  decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila.  In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary. WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a security company in the europe in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. Our inability to move this money out of Congo all This while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information We gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality. Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund out of Congo, you can contact me through my email address above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us. I must use this opportunity and medium to implore You to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this Matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your Decision, while I await your prompt response.

I gave the mail to my daugther Jude to send the mail to any contacts she sees and may be a God fearing person will listen to our plight.I will want you as the receiver to read through it and think very well if you can help or render us any assistance. My husband Joseph Ejercito estrada was elected as the 13th President of the Philippines in May 1998 by the people of Philippines due to his popularity in the film industry made him to win the largest popularity in the history of election in Philippines.He has attain the position of Senate in 1987,then vice-president in May 1992 and later become the president 1998.My husband became mayor of his hometown, San Juan in 1969 but it was 1972 that he had a string of public successes. My husband was named one of the ten Outstanding Young Men in Public Administration. He was also named Most Outstanding Mayor and Foremost Nationalist and Most Outstanding Metro Manila Mayor.  My husband is recently accused of illegal acquire some four Billion Peso ($80M) during his 31 months in office as President backed up by an uprising of mass Demonstrators and Senate Traitors. They also said that he has skimmed off tobacco excise Taxes benefitting from government business deals.Most of them benefitted from my husband's generousity when he was in office. But they just turned around to be the ones to impeach him. I have tried every possible means to get him out of Detention without success. The Despotic forces in power appear bent in deriding him, rubbishing his achievements while freezing all his known Bank accounts.He has been accused of economic plunder carrying the maximum penalty of death. To the worst of it all,all other wives of my husband especailly Guia Gomez and some of his children born outside wedlock are testifying against us.In conjunction with the PCGG funded by the recent President Arroyo Macapagal Gloria. These are some of the allegations file!  before my husband in the impeachment trial;  1. Gov. Luis Singson, a longtime friend of my husband, said he provided the my husband with more than $8 million in payoffs from illegal gambling and $2.7 million from tobacco taxes.  2. Witnesses testify one of an account in the Philippines third largest bank held millions of dollars in bribes collected by my husband. Equitable PCI Bank President George Go resigns. The banks senior vice president, Clarissa Ocampo, said she saw my husband sign a false name to documents withdrawing $10 million from a secret personal account.  3. On Dec 31 Five synchronized bomb attacks kill 22 people and injure more than 120 in Manila, days before the trial is to return from holiday recess. Police accuse Muslim rebels but many fear the bombs may be linked to the trial.  4. That my husband received about $8.5 million in pay-offs from illegal gambling operators. 5. That my husband participated in a real estate business controlled by me and my son Jose despite a prohibition on outside business interests while in office. My husband is suffering from bronchitis and emphysema right now and he detained at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City in hospital prison outside Manila where the life of my husband is in danger.I will let you know that it is political motivated by Gloria Arroyo.Meanwhile,the government has said that it may drop rebellion charges against my husband allies Senator Juan Ponce Enrile and the former ambassador to the United State Ernesto Maceda because they were in the side of my husband,both men were later jailed by the government of Gloria Arroyo that they instigated a march on the presidential palace by 50,000 supporters of my husband.These are all political.All these are done to have my husband death. Presently ! life has not been easy for my children and I,my travelling documents have been seized by the government and they restricted me and my children to have access to my husband.  Haven seen the way things are going with us.He decided to let me know that he deposited some money with Bank in Europe.He said that he deposited the sum of twenty Million dollars $20,000,000 in Banesto Bank Valencia Spain.Now I want to start a new life with the money.I want to invest the money outside Philippines.

We  advised that you look for a house we will buy as soon  as we arrived.  To conclude this transaction, you will be required to  come to Togo to open an account in any bank here in  Togo where the security company will deposit the total  sum in your favor. From this bank the money will be  remitted into your original bank in your country.  Immediately this done, all of us will depart Togo to  your country, where my children and I are expected to  take a temporary resident.

I work with the  Union Bank of Nigeria PLC; currently I am the senior  manager of bills and exchange at the foreign  remittance department of my bank. I was the account  officer to one Mr. Ali B. Ashraf who died along with  his family on the 8th of November 1996 in an ADC  Boeing 727 plane crash at Egirin River. All 141  passengers on board were feared dead.  He left in his domiciliary account the total sum of  Sixty Five Million United States Dollars [$65million]  Since the management got the information of his  death we have been expecting any of his relation or  his next of kin to come up and claim his money.  Unfortunately from the day of his death till the time  of this letter none of his relation or friends has  come up for the claim. The banking and financial law  of Union bank of Nigeria Plc stipulates that if such  fund remained unclaimed after a period of four years (4) it  will be transferred into the bank treasury as  unclaimed bill. On this discovery sir, I and a colleague of mine  now decided do business with you and  release the money to you as the next of kin to Ali B.  Ashraf for safety and subsequent disbursement. I will  soon proceed for my retirement in the middle of  this year, and I  personally do not want this fund to be transferred  into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. That is why  I wanted the fund to be move out of the bank before I  proceed on my retirement from the banking services by  june 15th 2003.  The need for a foreigner as next of kin in this  project is occasioned by the fact that the customer  Mr. Ali Ashraf was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot  stand as his next of kin or heir. We have agreed that  15% of the Fund would be for you as foreign partner;  thereafter my colleague and I will visit your country  for disbursement according to the percentages  indicated. To enable the immediate transfer of the  fund into your nominated account, you will first apply  to the bank as the next of kin of the deceased,  indicating your bank account number and location  wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of  your acknowledgement indicating your interest, I will  send to you the text of the application that you will  send to the Union Bank authority for an approval to  submit your claims.  Send your reply through my direct  private email  address and indicate  your direct  Fax and telephone numbers for effective communication  that this transaction is required. Do not reply through the  union bank email address because it will fall at the receptionist's  desk and is for public use .  Please note that you are not to appear in person, as  every thing regarding this project will be strictly on  documentations and every banking documents needed for  this transaction will be taken care of by my self.

Let me start by introducing myself properly to you.I am Mr. malcom tutu     ,  an auditor with Ned Credict Bank, Johannesburg, South Africa .  MY  PROPOSITION:  A Foreigner a french, Late Engr.Peter Claude  (Snr) a merchant in  The Republic of South Africa, Formerly working in  Witwatersrand Johannesburg Gold Mine, Johannesburg South Africa  until his death few year ago in Kenya Air Bus (A310 - 304)Flight KQ431,  He banked with us at Ned Credict Bank Johannesburg and had a closing  balance as at the end of September, 2000 worth $30,800.000.00 (Thirty  Million eight hundred United State Dollars), (this is aside the accrued  interest so far from that date) the bank now expects his next of kin  as beneficiary. Valuable efforts are being made by the Bank to get in  touch with any of the Claude\'s Family or Relatives but to no success.  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his  next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release  it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the  deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we  learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside  with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate  any of Late Engr. Peter Claude (Snr.)\'s next of kin . The Management  under the influence of our Chairman and Members of the Board of  Directors, Thus that arrangement will be made for the fund to be decleared  "Unclaimed" and subsequentlly be donated to the trust fund for arms and  ammunition to further enhance the course of War in Africa and the World  in General.  In order to avert this negative development, some of my trusted  colleagues and I, now seek your permission to have you stand as next of  kin to the late Engr.peter Claude  (Snr.) so that the fund will be  released and paid into your Account as the beneficiary/next of kin.  The request of  foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned  by the fact that the customer(Claude) was a foreigner and a Local person here  in the country  cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.  All documents and proves to enable you get this fund will be carefully  worked out. We have secured from the probate registry, an order of  Mandamus to locate any of the deceased\'s beneficiary(ies), and more so  we are assuring you that this business is 100% Risk Free. Your share  will be 30% of the total sum while 10% will be set aside for any  expences incured during the course of transaction, The rest of 60% will  be for myself and my colleagues for investment purposes, According to  agreement between both parties.  Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as  arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin  of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number,  your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective  communication and location where-in the money will be remitted . I will  also instruct you on how you can add in your application to our bank so  that you get paid through our corresponding bank  overseas as this will  be easier for us.

My message to you is based  on some money that floated into the Government treasury due to the  recent boom in the International Oil Market.  The Federal Government of Nigeria budgeted US$18.00 per barrel in last  Year budget, but the price was changed in the international oil market  where a barrel was sold between US$28-US$35.00.  We recorded Excess gain, and all these could not be accounted for,  hence some executive members in the Petroleum Ministry decided to take away  the sum of US$18,532,700.00, (Eighteen Million Five Hundred and Thirty  Two Thousand Seven Hundred United States Dollars) to an offshore  account of a foreign National or company.

From: Mr. Charles Nwodo Universal Trust Bank.website:www.utbplc.com Dear friend, This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met. The message could be strange but real if you pay some attention to it.  I could have notified you about it at least for the sake of your integrity. Please accept my sincere apologies. In writing you this message, I have to say that  I have no intentions of causing you any embarrassment.   I am Mr. Charles Nwodo Manager with Universal Trust Bank  Plc. of Nigeria, Island Branch. I managed to get your contact details through the Internet myself.  Time is of the importance and I am desperately looking for a person to assist me in this confidential business. A British oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian  National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Claude Brian Best made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit on January 6, 1999, valued at US$2,500,000.00 (Two Million Five  Hundred Thousand US Dollars), for twelve (12) calendar months in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.   After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Claude Brian Best died  in an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Claude Brian Best did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank  Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$2,500,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 4 (four) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government  if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Claude Brian Best so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into  the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary  documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.  We shall employ the service of two lawyers for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the  necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer  of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this  transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below; charlesnwodo@dr.com.  Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.  Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your  country.

REPLY TO EMAIL ADDRESS:   williamsd3@rediffmail.com Dear Friend, SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I will crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is MR Williams Daniel of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace. Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately  decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila.  In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary. WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a security company in the europe in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. Our inability to move this money out of Congo all This while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information We gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality. Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund out of Congo, you can contact me through my email address above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us. I must use this opportunity and medium to implore You to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this Matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your Decision, while I await your prompt response.

My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal Government of Nigeria�s Contracts Review Panel who are interested in diverting some funds that are presently floating in the accounts of the Central Bank of Nigeria.In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said floating funds. We are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this financial quarter. The source of the funds are as follows: During the last military regime, government officials awarded contracts that were grossly over-invoiced to  Contractors.The present civilian government set up the Contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel,  to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts. My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which  are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes. However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants and  members of this panel,we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore been mandated, as a  matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of U.S.$16,500,000.00(sixteen Million,five hundred  thousand U.S. Dollars). That is why I am writing you this letter. We have agreed to share the money to be transferred into your account, if you agree with our proposition as follows; (i) 10% to the account owner (you). (ii) 80% for us (the panel officials). (iii) 10% to be used in settling all expenses (by both you and us )incidental to the actualisation of this project. We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock markets and other business till we are ready and able to have access to them. Please note that this transactionis 100% safe and risk-free.We intend to effect the transfer within a few days from the date of receipt of the following information: Your name, company�s name, address and telephone and fax numbers, and your banking information. The above information will enable us write letters of claim andjob description respectively. This way, we will use your company�s name to apply for the payment and backdate the  award of the contract to your company. We are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction.

Thank you for your anticipated cooperation.  My Sincere Regards.  Dr Pascal Ugoti ", "REF This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not met.The message could be strange but real if you  pay some attention to it. Please accept my sincere apologies.In bringing this message of goodwill  to you, I have to say that I have no intention of causing you any pains. My name is SENATOR GBENGA ALUKO, the executive Chairman Pension funds committee in the senate of the federal Republic Of Nigeria. I am writing you  to earnestly Solicit your assistance in helping to receive some sum of money. I got your e-mail address on the Internet while searching for a reliable and reputable person to handle this transaction. THE PROPOSITION:  We have the sum of US$9,000,000.00 (Nine Million Dollars) that we intend to transfer overseas through the assistance of a foreign partner.This money came as a result of the  unclaimed pension funds belonging to a British expatriate petroleum  engineer with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,Engr.John  Bruno. After all other pensioners have been paid their entitlements, we deposited this unclaimed sum of US$9,000,000.00,with the Debt  Reconciliation Committee.  In a bid to make sure Engr.John Bruno gets his due,I sent a routine  notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,  the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Engr.John Bruno died, from an automobile accident.On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Engr.John Bruno did not declare any kin or relations in all his  official documents.This sum of US$9,000,000.00 is still sitting in an account of the Debt Reconciliation Committee and the interest is being  rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.No one will  ever come forward to claim it.  According to Nigerian Law,at the expiration of 2 (two) years,the money  will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody  applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Engr.John Bruno so that the  fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some  corrupt government officials.This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names,address,telephone and fax numbers so  that I can prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will  put you in place as the next of kin to Engr Bruno. Upon this,we would then obtain the letter of probate/administration in  your favor from a Federal High Court.A bank account in any part of the  world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money  to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio  of 65% for me and my partners,30% for you and 5% for any expences  incured,during the course of this transaction. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done at the high court and my position as the Chairman of the  Committee guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.The  fund shall be transferred to you legally in accordance to all laid down  procedures governing transfer of funds.If you are interested, please reply  immediately via my email address.  Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the  transaction.Please observe utmost confidentiality,and rest assured  that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because  I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via my email address. Thanks and regards, Sen.Gbenga Aluko", 'US$10,000,000 (United States Ten Million Dollars) Investment. Dear sir ,  I am Mrs. Mrs. Grace Abba-Ganna, personal accountant to Late Chief Bola   Ige(SAN) the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of   Justice, who wasrecently assassinated at his country home on the 23rd   December, 2001 by assassins (May his gentle soul rest in peace) Amen.  Before his death,he entrusted a certificate of deposit valued   US$10,000,000 (United States Ten Million Dollars), with a security company in   Europe.He told me that this money was deposited for him by the Former   Military Head of State Rtd. General Ibrahim Babangida to protect his   interest not to appear at the Oputa panel for re-conciliation and human   rights violation investigation commission headed by Rtd. Justice Chukwudife   Oputa.  My reason of contacting you is for both of us to join heads and hands  together to make claim over the US$10,000,000, as this money was  deposited on my favour at the security company as instructed by the   late Attorney General, to avoid trace of his name over accepting such gift   or offer.  His intention before his death was to contact a foreign partner who is  trust worthy, capable of handling such huge amount of money and also  operate a foreign account where the money will be deposited or paid  into waiting for his retirement. The reason is because our country law  states that civil servants are not entitled to operate foreign   accounts.  As it is now, with your full co-operation both of us can make claim  over the US$10,000,000, what is expected of you is:  (a) Your full name and address   (b) Your phone and fax number  (c) Your International Passport or Drivers license and your readiness  to appear at the security company to sign off the money to your  personal account.  As soon as I confirm your interest, I will forward to you the  certificate of deposit, power of attorney/transfer which will give you   legal backing to make claim over the money at the security company. I   will also forward to you the contact particulars of the Security Company   and letter of agreement between both of us over the security of my fund   that will be in your custody.  For accepting to help out 30% of the US$10,000,000 will be for you, 60%  for me and 10% set aside for re-imbursement of expenses incurred by  both  parties during the transaction.

DIRECTOR PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION (MEMR)    DIRECT TEL NO: 0027 731 522 629   Dear Sir,  I am an Engineer with the South African Ministry of Energy and Mineral  Resources and I am also a member of the Republic of South Africa Contract  Award and Monitoring Commitee in the Ministry of Energy and Mineral  Resources. It is a pleasure involving you in this project. Although, this  may sound strange but I seek your indulgence and pray you view it seriously.  Two years ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in the Ministry of  Energy and Mineral Resources by my committee. This contract was over  invoiced to the tune of US$14.3Million. This was done delibrately. The over  invoicing was a deal by my commitee to benefit from the project. We now  desire to transfer this money which is in a suspense account with the MEMR  into any oversea account which we expect you to provide for us.  For providing the account where we shall remit the money, you will be  entitled to 30% of the money, 10%  will be set aside for expenses incurred  by both parties during course of transfer, while the remaining 60%will be  for my partners and myself.    I would require the following:    1)Bank details ( Name and address / Account no/Beneficiary name )    2)Private Telephone and Fax number of Beneficiary  The above information would be used to make formal application as a matter  of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer to your  account. It does not matter whether or not your company does contract  projects of this of this nature described here, the assumption is that your  company won the major contract and subcontracted it out to other companies.  More often than not, big trading companies or firms of unrelated fields  win major contracts and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution  of such contracts. We have strong and reliable connections, top government  contacts at the South Africa Reserve Bank and Ministry of Finance and we  have no doubt that all this money will be released and transferred if we get  the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal. Therefore, when the  business is successfully concluded we shall through our connection withdraw  all documents used from all the concerned Government Ministries for 100%  security. We are civil servants and we will not want to miss this  opportunity.  Please contact me immediately through my above Telephone or email contact,  whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will  enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal. But  where you are interested, send the required informations aforementioned  herein without delay as time is of essence in this business.  I want to assure you once again that this transaction is 100% risk free  both now and in the future.  I await in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.  Yours faithfully,  Engr.Zulu Makaleni.

On June  6,  1997, an American Mining Consultant/Contractor with the South African  Mining  Corporation, Mr. Ken Power made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for  twelve  (12) calendar months, valued at US$28,320,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to  his  forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  contract employers, the South African Mining Corporation that Mr. Ken  Power  died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out  that  he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin  was  fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that  Mr.  Ken Power did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his  official  documents, including his Bank Deposit paper work in my Bank. This sum  of  $28,000,000.00 USD is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is  being  rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African  Law,  at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the  ownership  of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.  Consequently, my proposal is that I would like you to stand in as the  next  of kin to Mr. Ken Power so that the fruits of this old man's labour  will not  get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is  simple, I  will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so  that the  Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will  put  you in place as the next of kin.  We shall employ the service of an Accredited Attorney for drafting and  notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and  letter of  Probate/Administration in your favour for the transfer. A bank Account  in  any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the  transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money  will  be paid into your Account for us to share in the ration of 60% for me  and  40% for you.  There is no risk at all as the paper work for this transaction will be  done  by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the  successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please  reply immediately email.  Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and  relevant  documentsthat will help you understand the transaction.

', 'MY FRIEND, PLEASE I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU TODAY My Dear Friend,  My name is Dr. Ben Mboye, a Uganda national. I was the Permanent Secretary of Defense & Accounting Officer in Uganda. One of my reasons for contacting you is to share my joy with you that I have been exonerated and cleared by Hon Justice Julie Sebuntinde from the probe that involves three junk Chopper Helicopter purchased from Russia. My second reason is to ask you about the possibility of investing in your country that I believe we can embark upon together.  Due to the strong campaign by President Yowery Museveni to subdue the rebel forces of Joseph Kony in my country, directive was given in 1997 for the need to purchase some fresh arms and ammunitions abroad, which includes 3 MI-24 Chopper Helicopter Gunship that have night vision and anti-missile devices from Russian. When my superiors in authority concluded the negotiation for the purchases, I was told to prepare a “contract” for the purchases of the Helicopters, which I did as the Permanent Secretary of Defence and Accounting Officer. It will amaze you to hear that after the Belarusian suppliers delivered the three MI-24 Helicopters to Uganda, inspection was carried out and it was discovered that the three MI-24 helicopters were junks. Further investigation revealed that Lt. Gen. Salim Saleh who is a younger brother to the President and his Aide-de-Camp (Mr. Ruyondo) connived with the Russian company to supply helicopter that are almost out of service (junks) and they were not overhauled for selfish financial gains.  When Hon Justice Julie Sebuntinde probed the case, a report was released stating that The Chief of Logistics and Engineering, The Minister of State for Defence and myself have been exonerated and cleared from the offence. Please, check: (http://allafrica.com/stories/200212120154.html). Nevertheless, I lost my job and was prohibited from participating in public services.  PLEASE NOTE: In my long years of service to my country, I was able to acquire valuable fixed assets and substantial amount of money. Why the probing of the case was going on, I was advised by my Lawyer to sell off all my acquired properties that worth million of American dollars and also to withdraw my money from my bank account to save them from being frozen and confiscated. Due to the necessity for to lie low, I delegated power to my closest aide Mr. Mike Obodoh to be in charge of my projects.  The money realized from the sales of my properties was added to the money that was withdrawn from my account and the total amount was US$15,500,000.00 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Since I could not lodge this fund into any bank account for fear of being traced, the money was packaged and deposited with a Security Company that belong to a Holland national, based in South Africa for safekeeping. The funds are security coded and well packaged in a sealed luggage to prevent them from knowing the content. Arrangement is going on for the money to be moved from its current location to an affiliate security company in Europe by Mr. Mike Obodoh who is currently in The Netherlands to transact this business with you since I want my identity to be kept out of the money.  What I want from you at this moment is to indicate your interest and willingness to receive this money for investment purposes in your country. You are going to work hand-in-hand with Mr. Mugelbe Jones whom I have authorised to send this proposal to you in The Netherlands. As soon as you receive this email, you are advised to contact him on his email address: (miobod@hotmail.com.) .He will let you know the modalities to claim the funds and also give you his phone number when you contact him. You will assist me in the investment of this money, but I will not want my identity revealed. I will also want to buy properties and stocks in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments with your assistance. At this point, I want to emphasise the high level of confidentiality, which this business demands and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence that I repose on you.  As soon as I receive your response, we will discuss other modalities including remuneration for your services. You can also reach me on my email address: drben211@yahoo.co.uk  As you already know, time is of great essence in this transaction, kindly confirm your telephone and fax number to Mr. Mike Obodoh. Bear in mind that this project can be concluded within five days if you are prompt in your response.  Kind personal regards,  DR. BEN MBOYE.', 'Dear Sir/Madam,  I am Muyiwa Ige Bank Manager of Zenith Bank, Lagos, Nigeria. I have  urgent and Very confidential business proposition for you.  In February 28, 1998, a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the  Nigerian  National Petroleum Corporation, Mr.Barry Kelly made a numbered time  (Fixed)Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20,000,000.00  (Twenty  Million Dollars)in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine  notification  to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered from his  contract  employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry  Kelly  died from an automobile accident.On further investigation, I found out  that  he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of  kin  was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry  Kelly  did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,  including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$20,000,000.00 has carefully been moved out of my bank to  a security company for safekeeping.No one will ever come forward to  claim  it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the  money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody  applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will want you as a Foreigner to  stand  as the next of kin. I am writing you because as a public servant  (Manager  with the bank), I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account  that  is more than $1m. I therefore want to present you as the next of kin  (the  rightful owner of the fund) so that you can be able to claim it with  the  help of an accredited attorney.  Finally, I urge you to provide immediately your full names, phone/fax  numbers and your current mailing address so as to enable us commence  the  paperwork that will present you as the rightful beneficiary (next of  kin) of  the fund.  As soon as the money is transferred to you 70% is for me while 20% is  for  you and 10% will be for any expences made. Please reply immediately via  my Email address. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with  more  details that will help you understand this hitch free (risk free)  transaction.  Thanks and God bless.

He was among those who died in a plane crash here in Nigeria during the reign of late General Sani Abacha.  Since the demise of this our customer, Engineer Joseph Schultzman, who was an oil merchant/contractor, I have kept a close watch of the deposit records and accounts and since then no body has come to claim the money in this a/c as next of kin to the late Engineer. He had only $38.5mllion in his a/c and the a/c is coded. It is only an insider that could produce the code or password of the deposit particulars. As it stands now, there is nobody in that position to produce the needed information other than my very self considering my position in the bank.  Based on the reason that nobody has come forward to claim the deposit as next of kin, I hereby ask for your co operation in using your name as the next of kin to the deceased to send these funds out to a foreign offshore bank a/c for mutual sharing between myself and you. At this point I am the only one with the information because I have removed the deposit file from the safe .  By this doing, what is required of you is to send an application laying claims of the deposit as next of kin to the late Engineer. I will need your full name and address, company or residential, so that i can computerize them to tally with next of kin column in the certificate of deposit. Finally I want you to  understand that the request for a foreigner as the next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and for that reason alone a local cannot represent as next of kin.

I have urgent and very  confidential business proposition for you. On June 6  1998, a gold merchant/contractor with the  Randgold Exploration Company, Mr. Jim Smith made a  numbered time (Fixed) deposited for  twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00  (Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his  forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we  sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  contract employers, Randgold Exploration company Ltd  that Mr. Jim Smith died from an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found  out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to  trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made  further investigation and discovered that Mr. Jim  Smith did not declare any next of kin in all his  official documents, including his Bank Deposit  paperwork.  This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in the  Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the  principal sum at the end of each year. No one will  come forward to claim it. According to the Nigerian  Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money  will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian  Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a  foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Jim  Smith so that the fruits of this old man's labour will  not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This  is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately  with your full names and address so that the attorney  will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits,  which will put you in place as the next of kin. I  would also like you to scan you drivers license for  me.  We shall employ the services of two attorneys for  drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the  necessary documents and letter of  probate/administration in your favour for the  transfer. A  bank account in any part of the world, which you  provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this  money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money  will be paid into your account for us to share in the  ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. There is no risk  at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will  be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch  official guarantees the successful execution of this  transaction.  If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon  your response, I shall then provide you with more  details and relevant  documents that will help you understand. Please  observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that  this transaction would be most profitable for both of  us because I shall require your assistance to invest  my share in your country.

May I crave your indulgence to open this business discussion by a formal letter of this sort. It is pertinent that a business of this magnitude should have commenced properly with a formal meeting of you and us to enable us know ourselves, have a fore knowledge of the nature of the business, discuss and acquaint ourselves with the responsibilities and functions of parties concerned, and appropriate shares accordingly. However, for time factor, confidentiality and personality of people involved here in Nigeria, we choose this approach for the remittance of this Fourty Five Million U.S. Dollars (US$45M). Please bear with us for making the initial contact through e-mail. But my partners are insisting for a meeting in order not to fall into a wrong hand again.  I am Dr Ali Mohammed,we are members of the special committee for Budget and Planning of the Ministry Petroleum. This committee is principally concerned with contract appraisal and the approval of the contracts in order of priorities as regards capital projects of the past military government of Nigeria. With our positions, we have successfully secured for ourselves this sum of Fourty Five Million U.S. Dollars (US$45M). This amount was accumulated through undeclared windfall sales of crude oil during the gulf war. Hence together with two of our top officials at the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), we plan to transfer this amount of money into a secure overseas account by awarding a sort of contract from the NNPC. To this effect I have been given the mandate by my colleagues to contact you and ask for your assistance. What we need from you is to provide a nice account in which the funds will be transferred. My colleagues and I have agreed to compensate you or the owner of the account used for this transaction with 30% of the total amount remitted. We shall have 65% and the remaining 5% reserved for taxes and other miscellaneous expenses in your country.  It may interest you to know that last two years a similar transaction was carried out with one Mr. Patrice Miller, the President of Craine International Trading Corporation at number 135 East 57th Street, 28th Floor, New York, NY 10022 with telephone number (212) 308-7788 and telex number 6731689. After the agreement between both partners in which he was to take 20% of the money while the remaining 80% for us.  With all the required documents signed, the money was duly transferred into this account only to be disappointed on our arrival in New York, and we were reliably informed that Mr. Patrice Miller was no longer on that address while his telephone and telex numbers have been reallocated to somebody else.  That was how we lost US$9 Million to Mr. Patrice Miller. This time around we need a more reliable and trustworthy person or a reputable company to do business with hence this letter to you. So if you can prove yourself to be trusted and interested in this deal then we are prepared to do business with you. What we want from you is the assurance that you will let us have our share if this amount (US$45M) is transferred into your account. If this proposal is okay by you, then reply through my email urgently so that we can set the ball rolling and negotiate the modalities involved. Kindly, treat as very important and strictly confidential, I honestly assure you that this transaction is 100% risk-free. I look forward to your response and expected co-operation and God bless you.

Dear Sir,  I am BARRISTER. ADA USMAN the lawyer of the late Gen. Sani Abacha, former head of State of Nigeria who died on 8th June 1998 while in office. Since the death of abacha the present Government of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has been formenting members of the Abachas family including family friends. All businesses and property owned by the Abachas have been confiscated by the Government and all our Bank Account in Nigeria and abroad have been frozen. A quick reference of Newsweek publication of March 13th 1999 were 88million dollars was taken from us will give you an insight of what I have gone through. After a short while I was arrested and detained in prison custody, the government came up with a trump up charge against me and honestly speaking I have been in detention since November 1999 and I  was only released on Thursdays (11-07-02) by the supreme court of Nigeria who passed judgment in my favor During the reign of abacha as the president of this country, an Aluminum Smelter Company of Nigeria (Alscom) contract was revalued. The contract was for the construction of plant, at Ikuta Abasi in Akwa Ibom State of Nigeria, for production of ingots and billets required as raw material for  Aluminum and Allied Industries, Reynolds Incorporated of America, Phoenix and M&F Companies of Switzerland conducted the feasibility studies. The contract was awarded to Ferrostall AG of Germany. However, after the revaluation of the contract, Ferrostall AG collected its own share of the increment in project cost, while abacha share of fifty-eight Million u.s. Dollars (US$58,000,000:00) was kept in our native town in Kano State Nigeria. I know that abacha was planning of how to send this money abroad before his sudden death in June 8 1998.  We have being looking for the best means to send this money abroad.  Luckily for me Nigeria was made a center for the distribution of relief marterial to the people of victims of civil war in Africa by the common wealth organization. So I made some contact  with a Common wealth officer here , and secretly deposited the money with APEX FINANCE AND SECURITIES GROUP here in Nigeria . This US$58M was secretly packaged in a trunk box, Hence all plane is to ship this money abroad through a diplomatic means with out the knowledge of anybody outside. I declared that my foreign business partners owned them. This was to bit the security system in Nigeria from knowing my involvement in this money presently, I am handicapped as what next to do since I am not conversant with international monitory policies. Hence I am contacting you as a reputable and trust worthy person, with a well experience and able hand to help.  Because I want you to claim the money on my behalf since I have declared that the consignment belongs to my foreign business partners. Actually I got your contact from a reliable source, and also I believe you are in a good position to assist me to transfer these fund to your country for good investment.  My contract with EURO CREDIT COMMISSION remains few weeks to expire and I am down broke to renew the duration with the Security  Company.  As a matter of urgency, I will like you to send to me immediately your telephone and fax number. I shall send you all the clearance documents by fax. I will then forward your name as the beneficiary and my foreign business partner to the Security Company.  You will be entitled to 20% of the total sum involved for your assistance Your URGENT response is needed. All your REPLY must go through this email: adausman@hknetmail.com also.  Please kindly uses this email also for security reason. I will need your private and direct telephone and fax number for easy reach.

Best regard   ADA USMAN.(EQS) ", "between us I am Mr. John Nlobo, Bank Manager of United Bank For  Africa , Capetown Branch. I have urgent and very  confidential business proposition for you. On June 6  1998, a gold merchant/contractor with the  Randgold Exploration Company, Mr. Jim Smith made a  numbered time (Fixed) deposited for  twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00  (Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his  forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we  sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  contract employers, Randgold Exploration company Ltd  that Mr. Jim Smith died from an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found  out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to  trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made  further investigation and discovered that Mr. Jim  Smith did not declare any next of kin in all his  official documents, including his Bank Deposit  paperwork.  This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in the  Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the  principal sum at the end of each year. No one will  come forward to claim it. According to the South  African  Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money  will revert to the ownership of the South African  Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a  foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Jim  Smith so that the fruits of this old man's labour will  not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This  is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately  with your full names and address so that the attorney  will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits,  which will put you in place as the next of kin. I  would also like you to scan you drivers license for  me.  We shall employ the services of two attorneys for  drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the  necessary documents and letter of  probate/administration in your favour for the  transfer. A  bank account in any part of the world, which you  provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this  money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money  will be paid into your account for us to share in the  ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk  at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will  be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch  Manager guarantees the successful execution of this  transaction.  If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon  your response, I shall then provide you with more  details and relevant  documents that will help you understand. Please  observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that  this transaction would be most profitable for both of  us because I shall require your assistance to invest  my share in your country.

ATTN:              URGENT ASSISTANCE NEEDED  You may be surprise to receive this Email from me since you do not know me  personally.  However, I would like to introduce myself. I am Michael Stevens Junior, the  son of Doctor. Simon Stevens. Who was murdered few months ago in Zimbabwe,  as a result of land dispute? Before the death of my father (Dr. Stevens), he  had taken me to Amsterdam and deposit the sum of Fifteen Million United  States dollars (US$15,000,000) in a security company, as he foresaw the  looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money in question was deposited in a box as  Gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company. The proposed  amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the  farms and establishment of new farms on Swaziland. As you may be aware this  land problem came into force when Zimbabwe president Mr. Robert Mugabe  Introduced the Land Reformed Act of which my father rich farmers and some  black farmers where affected. This resulted to the killing and Mob action by  Zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society, a lot of people were  killed because of this Land reformed act of which my dad was one of the  victims. It is against this background that my family and Iaugustim who are  currently staying in Amsterdam decided to transfer my father's money to a  foreign account. Since the Dutch law prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to  open any account or be involved in any financial transaction. As  The eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking  a genuine foreign account where the money could be transferred. I am faced  with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in Holland for the fear  of going through the same experience in future since both countries have  similar history. Moreover, The Netherlands foreign exchange policy does not  allow such investment from asylum seekers.

On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil Consultant/Contractor with the Nigerian   National   Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed)   Deposit   for   twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00(Twenty- five Million   Dollars) in my branch.    Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address   but got   no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered   from   his   contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that   Mr. Barry   Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I   found out   that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next   of kin   to date has fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry   Kelly did   not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,   including his   Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is   still   sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the   principal   sum   at the end of each year.    No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law,   at the   expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of   the   Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently,   my   proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the   next of   kin   to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old man’s labor will not   get   into   the hands of some corrupt government  officials.    This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names,   address, telephone and fax numers so that the Attorney will prepare the   necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the   next of   kin. We shall employ the service of another Attorney for drafting and   notarization   of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of   probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will   then   facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of   kin.    The money will be paid into your nominated account for us to share in   the   ratio   of 60% for me, 35% for you and 5% to cover any accidental expenses on   either   sides during the course of this transaction.  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will   be done   by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the   successful   execution of this transaction. Upon your   response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant   documents   that will help you understand the transaction better.   Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this   transaction   would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your   assistance   to invest my share in your country. Looking forward to hearing from you   soonest.  Best regards,  Dr Mike Odey.

Yetunde Bassey, Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria,Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.  On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an  automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old manÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% would be for settling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds arrive your country.  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately ONLY via any of my alternate private email addresses below otherwise I would not respond to you.  Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

In order to transfer out Twenty Two Million United  States Dollars from Chartered Bank (CB). I wish  to ask for your assistance, believing that you will  never let me down either now or in future. I got your  e-mail address from the e-mail directory in the  internet.  I am Mr..John Chukwu, the Chief Auditor of Chartered Bank (CB).  There was an account opened in this bank in 1983 and since 1989 nobody has  operated on this account till date. After my long investigation  to my greatest suprise I came to find out that the  owner of the account who is Mr.Peter B. Andreas, a  foreigner, crude oil exporter, who died in 1990.  This account has no beneficiary, infact no other  person knows about this account or anything about the  account, and my investigation proved to me as well  that this company does not exist anymore in NIgeria.  The amount involved is USD 22M, which i seek your  consent to transfer to a safe foreign account. I do  not know any foreigner that i can trust either than  you, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because  this money can not be claimed by a Nigerian because  the rightful owner of the account (Mr. Peter) is a  foreigner.  I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise  as we do not know each other before hand. we will be  needed to sign an Agreement as a security so that we  cannot betray the trust that will be given to  eachother in this legitimate and joint venture, which  demand utmost secrecy and confidential.  I am contacting you because of the need to involve a  foreigner with foreign account and foreign  beneficiary. I need your full co-operation for us to  have a successful transaction. Because the management  is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who  has correct information of this account, which I will  give to you immediately i receive your positive reply.  With my position now in the office I can authorise the  immediate transfer of this money to any foreign  reliable account which you can provide with assurance  that this money will be intact pending my physical  arrival in your country for sharing and further  investment. I will destroy all documents used in this  transaction immediately we must have transferred this  money to your nominated account sucessfully, so as to  avoid any document trace by any person.  I will apply for annual leave to get visa to your  country immediately you confirm me that you are  willing to assist me. I will also use my position and  influence to effect legal approvals and onward  transfer of this money to your account with  appropriate clearance forms of the ministries and  foreign exchange departments.

FROM THE DESK OF PETER OKOYE  STANDARD TRUST BANK PLC  Tel: 234-1-7760497  Fax: 234-1-7599947  Private Email:peteoko@gawab.com  I hope this letter will not embarrass you since we have not had any previous communication. I got your reference from your country`s trade department under private enquiry that is not related to my aim of writing you this letter and went further to have it confirmed by the Nigeria Exports Promotion Council(NEPC).  I am Mr. Peter Okoye, a Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank Plc, Lagos Balogun Branch.  I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, an American Oil Consultant/Contractor with the National Oil Nigeria Ltd. Mr. Robert Noel made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months. Valued at US$48,000,000.00 (Forty-Eight Million United States Dollars only) in my branch upon maturity.  I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the National Oil Nigeria LTD that Mr. Robert Noel died on air crash in ADC Airline going to Abuja our Federal Capital Territory. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making “WILL”, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Robert Noel did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$48,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigeria Law, at the expiration of 5 (Five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to act as the next kin to Mr. Robert Noel so that the fruits of this old man’s labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials here.  This transaction is very simple and 100% risk free, therefore I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that an Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the “WILL” and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate and realization in your favour for the transfer.  A Bank Account in any part of the world, which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.

I look forward to your earlist response to my proposal.  Yours Truly.  Mr Peter Okoye  Branch Manager. ', '??????????  FROM THE DESK OF PETER OKOYE  STANDARD TRUST BANK PLC  Tel: 234-1-7760497  Fax: 234-1-7599947  Private Email:peteoko@gawab.com  I hope this letter will not embarrass you since we have not had any previous communication. I got your reference from your country`s trade department under private enquiry that is not related to my aim of writing you this letter and went further to have it confirmed by the Nigeria Exports Promotion Council(NEPC).  I am Mr. Peter Okoye, a Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank Plc, Lagos Balogun Branch.  I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, an American Oil Consultant/Contractor with the National Oil Nigeria Ltd. Mr. Robert Noel made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months. Valued at US$48,000,000.00 (Forty-Eight Million United States Dollars only) in my branch upon maturity.  I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the National Oil Nigeria LTD that Mr. Robert Noel died on air crash in ADC Airline going to Abuja our Federal Capital Territory. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making “WILL”, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Robert Noel did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$48,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigeria Law, at the expiration of 5 (Five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to act as the next kin to Mr. Robert Noel so that the fruits of this old man’s labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials here.  This transaction is very simple and 100% risk free, therefore I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that an Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the “WILL” and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate and realization in your favour for the transfer.  A Bank Account in any part of the world, which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your Account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and 10% will be for expences both parties might have incured during the process of transfering the money.Try and call me on my private number immediately you recieve this email on 234-1-7760497 or write me back on my private email address(peteoko@gawab.com) for further explanations.  I look forward to your earlist response to my proposal.  Yours Truly.  Mr Peter Okoye  Branch Manager. ', "HELP FROM:MRS. M SESE-SEKO  DEAR FRIEND,  I AM MRS.

My brother was pushed out of office  and charged with treason, corruption and embezzlement  of over 21 billion won. He was wrongly sentenced to  death but fortunately AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL stepped in  and commuted the sentence to life. We thank God that  he has finally been released though still under house  arrest in the sense of the conditions of his freedom.  During my brother's regime as president of South  Korea, we realized some reasonable amount of money  from various deals that we successfully executed. I  have plans to invest this money for my children’s  future in real estate and industrial production.  Before my brother was overthrown, I secretly  siphoned the sum of $20,000,000.00 Million USD (Twenty  Million United States dollars) out of Seoul and  deposited the money with a Security Firm that  transports valuable goods and consignments through  diplomatic means.  I am contacting you because I want you to deal with  the Security Firm and claim the money on my behalf  since I have declared that the consignment belong to  my Foreign Business Partner. You shall also be  required to assist me in investments in your country.

Dear Sir, BUSINESS PROPOSAL: TRANSFER OF US$19.2 M (NINETEEN MILLION, TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) & BUSINESS INVESTMENTS PARTNERSHIP. First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by  virtue of it's nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to us in confidence through the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce, foreign trade division. and if the contents of this mail does meet with your approval, i humbly crave your indulgence.  I am the chairman of the Economic Recovery Committe (ERC) set up by the present civilian Government of Nigeria to review economic policies of government parastatals, and find out ways to reduce waste and maximise revenues allocated to them. In the course of our work at the ERC, we discovered this fund which resulted from gross re-valuation of contracts  by top government officials of the federal ministry of Aviation (FMA). The company that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$19.2 Million lying unclaimed in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria. Upon interogation of the directors of engineering and finance, who both happens to be my contemporaries in the university, they confessed to me in confidence that they had an agreement with the original contractor to re-value the original contract by 30%. This 30% which amounts to USD19.2m was to be their share from the contract, since the original contractor was well disposed towards giving them the conventional 10% kickback. When I now asked them what they intended to do now that my committee has discovered this USD19.2M. They begged me not to disclose this information to the government as they will likely lose their jobs and their family names destroyed.  I was at at a crossroad, as I did not want my friends to suffer for what other top government officials do and get away with. I discussed with the other two members of my committee and we all unanimously agreed to transfer this fund out and share amongst ourselves. I have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the committee to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US$19.2M legally sub-contracting the entitlement to you/your company.  This is bearing in mind that our  civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign company or running  foreign account while in government service hence the need for a foreign partner. Should this transaction interest you, you are to contact me on my personal e-mail address, so that I can brief you fully, and discuss your renumeration for this undertaking. All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction  within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information:  Your  full name/ company name, address, company's details & activities, telephone & fax numbers. These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely  based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers in America, Asia and Europe is going to be made out in your name.

Yetunde Bassey, Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria,Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.  On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Roger  Scott made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Roger  Scott died from an  automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Roger  Scott did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Roger  Scott that the fruits of this old man&#8217;s labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% would be for settling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds arrive your country.  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately ONLY via any of my alternate private email addresses below otherwise I would not respond to you.  Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I look forward to hearing from you soonest. Thanks and regards. DR.

I am married  to Dr. Harry Jones who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Co  ast for nine years before he died in the year  2000.  We were married for eleven years without a child. He died a  fter a brief illness that lasted for only  four days. Before his death we were both born again Christia  ns.Since his death I decided not to re-  marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bi  ble is against.When my late husband was alive he deposited the  sum of$8.6Million (Eight Million six hundred thousand U.S. D  ollars) with one finance/security company in Amsterderm Hollan  d. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company.  Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next  three  months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most i  s my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to  donate this fund to church or better still a christian individ  ual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruc  t here in. I want a church that will use this fund to fund chu  rches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and t  o ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made  us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.

I don?t want a situation where this money  will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking  this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know whe  re I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of th  e Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case  and I shall hold my peace. I don?t need any telephone communi  cation in this regard because of my health because of the pres  ence of my husband?s relatives around me always. I don?t want  them to know about this development. With God all things are p  ossible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the  contact of the Finance/Security Company in Amsterderm Holland  . I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove  you as the original-  beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always  pray for me because the lord is my shephard.

I am Mr. Phil Ipenza, Provincial Manager Development Bank of Southern Africa(DBSA). I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a foreign mining consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. Richard Moss made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$12,5 00,000.00 (Twelve Million,Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining Corporation that Mr. Richard Moss died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard Moss did not declare any kin or r!   elations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$12,500,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Richard Moss so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for processing and notarizat!   ion of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and lett!   er of pr  obate/administration in your favour for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via my email: Ipenza@themai!   l.com  Thanks and regards.  Mr. Phill Ipenza. ", "DR , DONALD  IKE Plot 1551 Richmond Avenue  G.R.A - Enugu  Dear sir,  TRANSFER OF $26,948,500.00 ON ACCOUNT NUMBER 262 -866-5050  I am contacting you in the belief that you are a honest and trustworthy person.I hope you will not betray the confidence I have in you to have contacted you even though we've not met before.Besides,I only got your address from an internet listing.  I am Dr.Donald Ike,Head of Banking Operations,Eastern Banking Unit of one of the biggest banks in Africa.I will not mention the name of the bank I work for security reasons but promise to disclose it to you as soon as I am convinced that you are capable and willing to assist me with this transaction.I hope this does not turn you off anyway;I am only being cautious.  The account numbers mentioned above  belong to late Engr.Philip De Wulf,a Belgian who was the managing director of Energy Services International ESI,a petrol and oil servicing company .This company has been a household name in the downstream sector of my country for its professional service provision especially in the late 80s but after the death of Engr.Wulf everything began to take a rather retrogressive trend largely due to the inefficiency of his successor.I personally manage the accounts of this company as well as the personal account of Engr.P.D.Wulf .Shortly before his death in a ghastly motor accident which claimed his life and that of his newly married wife Mrs.Debra Wulf in 1993,I had received some receivables in the form of cheque payment on behalf of my esteemed customer,Engr.Wulf and since he instructed that all personal cheques be paid to his online account,I followed the instruction to the latter.However as a result of his death!   ,this account remained unserviced for a long time neither was there any person named next of kin .The net balance of this account till date is One Hundred and Forty Eight Million,Nine Hundred and Forty Eight Thousand,Five Hundred United States Dollars($148,948,500.00).According to the Banking and Other Financial Act 1991 (as amended) of my country if such deposit is not claimed twelve years after the demise of the account holder,the Board of Directors should recommend to the Federal Authorites that efforts were actually made to establish the next - of -kin but due to non was specified by the deceased,that the Federal Government should inherit the account.The actual fact on ground is that the directors do not return such money to the Fedeal Authorities,instead they share and stach it in their foreign accounts amongst themselves.This should go far to explain why the bank is not making any effort in trying to locate any relation of this man fo!   r about a decade now but individual investigation conducted by myself  shows that there is no information about his relations mentioned in any of the account opening documents filed at the bank.  All I want you to do is to collaborate with me by standing in as the beneficiary because Management is ready to approve the remittance of the money to any foreigner who has correct information of this account.Beside I would use my position to facilitate prompt remittance of the fund.Send to me immediately the your business porofile as well as your bank account information of any bank of your choice where you want the money to be transfered.You may open a new account if you so wish.If for any reason you think you're incapable of this transaction, you may recommend anybody whose integrity is not in doubt. I shall however provide you with directives on what to do as we proceed.Contact me on my private telephone numbers above or through my email address with information about your full contact addresses including personal telephone & fax numbers and Bank information immediately if you are interested. As soon as I get this information and I am convinced that you a!   re capable to do this transaction,I will consult a probate lawyer on your behalf as the beneficiary for the drafting and notarization of the will and to obtain the neccesary documents and letter of Probate/Administration in your favour so as to put you in better position as the beneficiary .Please you have to be eraborate in your profile to enable me make a good assessment about your desirability.I shall tell you the name of my bank soon after I am convinced of your personality.  I also need strong assurances from you to the effect that you can guarantee the safety of the money when it gets to your account.However,I want you to understand that as a man of strong character it beats my conscience that I have to do this deal for two strong reasons.Firstly ,to curtail the excesses of the directors and secondly to plan ahead of my retirement which is just few months from now.In view of this,you may be approached after the transfer to provide me with investment advice as I plan to invest the fund in any lucrative venture after retirement.  At the conclusion of this business, I shall travel to your country for sharing.I have mapped out 30% of the total amount for you for assisting me,5% to take care of all expenses from both party and the remaining for me.  I await information about you and look forward for prompt reply from you.  Warmest Regards.  Dr.Don Ike ", "GREETINGS! 140GC2 GARDEN PARK  IKOM ROAD.  BAKASSI PENINSULA.

Warmest regards,  Joseph Mobutu Sese-Seko ", 'PROJECT INTEREST. My dear friend,  I am Mr. Yetunde Bassey, Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria,Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.  On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Roger Scott made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Roger Scott made died from an  automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Roger Scott made did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Roger Scott  so that the fruits of this old man&#8217;s labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% would be for settling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds arrive your country.  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately ONLY via any of my alternate private email addresses below otherwise I would not respond to you.  Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I look forward to hearing from you soonest. Thanks and regards.

Tel: 41 79 530  99 35 Dear Sir/Madam, I am the expert  director heading Investments and Portfolio Management in the above-mentioned  firm in Switerland. I am contacting you in view of an urgent  assistance to carry out a pending transaction, which will develop a cordial  business relationship between you and me. One of my clients whom I have  personally managed his portfolio for 10 years now was a victim of a fatal car  crash. His name is Late Mr Saud Ed Abad AlKharj, he was survived by a fiance and  a two-year-old son from her as they intended getting married but where trying to  be cautious because of Islamic law attitude on adultery. This were his only  family and no next of kin, as he was the only child of Late Sheikh Hamza Al  Kharj Al Faisal, who received royalties from the Kuwaiti Government on one of  his fields which oil was discovered and subsequently explored (the Al Jazriah  Oil Field). All subsequent investigation to find a next of kin was  privately conducted by me and was futile. It was at this juncture that I and  other officials Managing his portfolio and 2 bank managers where he had his  accounts now  decided to make this proposal and transfer ownership of the  portfolio to an Agreeing party as beneficiary to the portfolio of the  deceased. The reason why ownership cannot be transferred to his  wife to be and only son is that Islamic law will not recognize such and if an  attempt is made on that it may put her in trouble with the authorities for  giving birth outside  marriage. So we have decided to help her by making this  proposal and making sure she gets a substantial part of Late Mr Saud Alkharj’s  property for her  and her son. You must be asking where I got  your mail address, it was made available to me by a junior director Mrs Cynthia  Philips in charge of customer services on request for contacts for investment  expansion for a client but she is not aware of this contact. All records and  accounts regarding the assets of deceased were managed by me for 10 years  running, if you are interested to assist us, all I will do is to incorporate in  the old records recognizing  you as the only beneficiary. The  banking law here stipulates that if such portfolio remains unclaimed after four  years it will go to the public department. The need for a foreigner as  beneficiary is occasioned by the fact that the deceased was not  permanently  resident in Switzerland. For your assistance, we made up of I, 2  senior directors in my firm and 2 bank managers in banks which the Kuwaiti  Government pay royalties, accruing to the deceased have agreed in fairness to  make available 25% of all bank  funds cleared and 15% of the royalties which  you will continue to receive on behalf of the deceased as sole beneficiary every  year. However we do not intend to share any interest with you as far as the  estates and property are  concerned, as they will be going to the surviving  wife and child. If you are okay with the above explanations, you  may reply us including all your contact telephone and fax numbers so that we may  confirm you genuine, after which we will make more information available to you  on how we will  proceed. I must further assure you that this  transaction is 100% legitimate and the modalities for this transaction is being  handled by top executives which assure a risk free transaction.Kindly visit my  firms website at www.royaltrust.com.

In my departmentn we discovered an abandoned sum of US$16.M (SIXTEEN MILLION, UNITED STATES DOLLARS).In an account that belongs to one of ourforeign customer who died along with his entire family in november 1998 in a plane crash.  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guideline  s but unfortunately welearnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim and other officials.  It is therefore upon this discovery that we decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want  this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.  The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after four years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.  The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.  we agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for ;me and my colleagues.  There after we will visit your country for disbursement accoding to the percentages indicated.

I apologize for using this medium to reach  you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is  due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.  Be informed that your enviable credentials/particulars were  given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion  Council who was at the Government delegation to your country  during a trade exhibition.

I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for  you. On Dec. 19, 1998, a Canadian Oil consultant/contractor with  the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Mr. Antoine Blanc  made a numbered timed(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months,  valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty Five Million Dollars)in my  branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his  forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a  reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,  the Ministry of Energy and Natural resources that Mr. Antoine  Blanc died from a plane crash. On further  investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will,  and all attempts to trace his next of kin was futile. I  therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.  Antoine Blanc did not declare any kin or relations in all his  official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my  security company.

No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years,  the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian  Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

A bank account either newly created or existing in any  part of the world which you will provide, will then facilitate  the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of  kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in  the ratio of 75% for me and 20% for you. Then 5% will be used to  offset any expenses incurred during the entire processing.  Please your percentage is not negotiable. it is considerate  enough.

', 'rrrrr,CONFIDENTIAL PARTNERSHIP SOLICITATION FROM: Miss THEMBI TENDAI  SUBJECT:Please Help  EMAIL FROM: thembi79@zwallet.com  REPLY EMAIL: thembi79@zwallet.com Dear Sir/Madam,  You may be surprised to receive this letter from me, Since you do not know me personally "My Name is THEMBI TENDAI" The purpose of my introduction is that Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US6 Million (Six Million United States dollars),in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black Farmers and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father " Mudada Abba " was one of the victims. It is against this back round that, I and my Mother and three   younger ones fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and I currently staying in the Netherlands in a village called Zwolle, where my family are seeking political asylum and more so I have decided to transfer my father\'s money to a more reliable foreign account. As the eldest daughter of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got. The South African government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future, both countries have similar political history.  As the Eldest daughter, I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment (funds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands as I have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South Africa.But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly this money I intend to use for investment. I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into Partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 10% of the money while the remaining 90% will be for my investment in your country. Should you which to assist me, please furnish me with your telephone and fax number me with the above via e-mail while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction.

Because of my strategic  Position in the former Government and also being a  Close confidant of the late Head of State.  I was able to acquire personally the sum of  $12,500,000.00 USD (Twelve Million, Five Hundred  Thousand United States Dollars only) presently lodged  In Security Company inform of Gold Bars in a security  company here in Nigeria. I did not want the management  of the Security Company to know the content of the  consignments; therefore I registered the content of  the consignments as Gold Bars. Now, the security  company believes that what I deposited with them was  Gold Bars  I made this money largely through "CONSULTANCY FEE"  And "Good Faith Fees" paid by foreign Oil companies  Prior to Allocation of Deep Water Oil Blocs and other  Lifting/prospecting Rights (Nigeria is the 6th largest  Producer/Exporter of Crude Petroleum in the World.  As you are probably aware Nigeria is prone to Military  Coups and the resultant Political/Economic Instability  has fueled hyper Inflation, amongst other problems.  I have therefore resolved to invest my money abroad,  preferable in Real Estate Properties and Importation  of Goods from your country for safety and optimum  returns on Investment.  However, straight transfer of this money into a bank  abroad will present two major problems one, the tax  incidence will be too high, as much as 60% of this  money will go up in Taxes, Levies, Penalties etc. as a  result of Government deliberate restrictions on flight  of capital Abroad. And also been accused of money  laundering  and terrorism, The solution is to Courier this money  cash abroad in form of consignment, through Courier  service Company here in Nigeria in  Conjunction with an embassy here in Nigeria, the money  will be packed in a "Diplomatic Bag/Carton" tagged  Diplomatic luggage that will be address to you.  This system is secret and the money is therefore  Untraceable. It is system used by most top Government  officials to remove their fortunes to safety abroad.  I have therefore concluded every arrangements with a  Courier Company in Nigeria to Courier this money  abroad using the courtesy and safety of Diplomatic  Bag. All I now need is an honest partner who can  receive the money on my behalf and help me to invest  as aforementioned. There is absolutely no risk  involved in this transaction as the money will be  delivered to you in United States Dollars Bills.  If you are interested in assisting me, please send to  me by email immediately your preferred contact address  where this money will be delivered to you, upon  delivery, you are to lodge this money in a bank  account and contact me for necessary arrangements for  the investment.  For your help and assistance in this deal, you will  receive 15% of this money in cash or Equity if you  wish to join the proposed company.  I have notified the Security Company where I deposited  the consignments that contained the fund, that I am  moving the consignment abroad and the security company  has since been waiting for my authority for the  consignment to leave my country and move to abroad.  So if you know that you will use this fund honestly as  I have instructed.  and the details will be given to you on how you will  be able to receive the fund in your country through  the security company. You should also forward to me  your telephone and fax number for easy communication  and to fax you the documents concerning the  consignments.  Your prompt response will be highly appreciated.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 2 years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next-of-kin of the deceased to claim the two trunk boxes since you are from the same country so that the two trunk boxes can be  delivered to you by the security company.

For the purpose of introduction, I am Mr. Donga Kabaka, the son of Dr. James Kabaka, a wealthy black farmer/politician in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country. The land problem, in our country came when our President Mr. Robert Mugabe in a bid to win his re-election, introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the black farmers who are members of the opposition (MDC) party. This resulted in killings and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. It is against this background that I and my immediate family had fled Harare our capital for fear of our lives and are currently staying in a country side of United Arab Emirate. We are planning to leave the country and seek political asylum in Europe and we have decided to move our family wealth to Europe. We got your contact through the Internet based on our urgent need for a dependable and trustworthy foreign partner and hence decided to write to you. Before the death of my late father, he had taken me to United Aram Emirate several times and had deposited the total sum of US$20.5 million (Twenty million, Five Hundred thousand United States dollars), in one of the private security companies, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was deposited in two boxes as Family Treasures to avoid much demurrage from the security company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and the establishment of new farms in Swaziland. As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine partner that could assist us without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got, and the United Arab Emirate seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of United Arab Emirate for fear of going through the same experience in future. We are seeking a partner whom I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his/her hands. To this end, we need your assistance to stand as the Beneficiary of the Consignments in Europe. This is because we are under restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in order not to lose this fund, which we have worked so hard for. I have a sufficient CONTACT person at the Security Company in United Arab Emirate who can help us move this money to Europe under DIPLOMATIC COVER to another Security Company in Europe with your details as the Beneficiary. This is 100% legal and will not pass through normal Customs/Airport Screening. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out of UAE, you can contact me through my email address with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss further details. I must let you know that this transaction is risk free as far as we keep it as confidential as possible. Thank you and many blessings to you. Yours Faithfully, Mr. Donga Kabaka.', 'THIS IS HUMANITERIAN SERVICE THAT REQUIRES YOUR ATTENTION! Hello my beloved kind hearted,  THIS IS HUMANITERIAN SERVICE THAT REQUIRES YOUR ATTENTION!  I simply want to take this occasion to tell you about my intention to contribute toward the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS and I need your help as my representative overseas. I need you to receive my financial entitlements from my financiers overseas on my behalf for the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS and hope you would not let me down.  It might interest you to know that in my supporting role to the Minister of Public Works here in Pretoria, South Africa it is my responsibility to handle some very intrinsic matters for, on behalf or with the Minister. By my duties, it is almost impossible for any file/Contract Proposals to get to the Minister for approval, without it passing through my scrutiny.  By my religious status and as the South African Deputy Minister of Public Works, I have cause to help a lot of foreign contractor-companies (mainly American) to secure the release of their entitlements from the coffers of the government of South Africa. I did this, principally, as a help to the concerned companies, but in appreciation of my efforts, most of them committed themselves to paying some handsome monetary honorarium to me. However, because of my position as a political appointee, it is impossible for me to collect such money immediately or even directly. Hence, I need you to collect this money on my behalf and use it as you would be further directed for the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS. Of course your effort will not be in vain. You would be well rewarded for your help in this regards.  All the money from the various companies put together is totaling amount to Eight Hundred and Fifty Five Thousand United States Dollars (US$855,000) only. The snag is that I just discovered that I couldn\'t collect this money, directly, from these companies in my name or the name of any of my family members, because government will investigate "why?" and "what for? Therefore, to forestall any such problems, I decided to contact you through this secured and private medium, to solicit your assistance in this regard.  You will receive this money on my behalf, and use it as you would be further directed. That way, there will be no link between the companies and me. I will instruct the concerned companies to make the money available to you on installment either via swift means or by cheque as you so desire of not more than $75,000, as the case may be.  >From the money you receive on my behalf, you would be entitled to retaining 10% of the sum while you would be required to wire the balance 90% for its purpose of humanitarian services as would be advised. For example, if you receive $75,000, you would be required to retain 10% ($7,500) while you wire the balance $67,500 for its purpose. This is basically on trust. It is a simple job you do for me and all expenses for the cost of transfer of funds would be from the 90% and you will not spend a single cent from your money to actualize this project. No financial commitment from you and it\'s simple and risk free. You receive the money on my behalf, take away your 10% and redirect the remaining 90% as would be instructed. I can assure you that if you keep to our agreement, this will be the beginning of a mutually beneficial relationship between the two of us. Afterward, there are a lot of other things we can do together that will fetch you a fortune.  If you are interested and would like to work with me for the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS, I would need you to provide me with the following:  (1) IF YOU DESIRE TO HAVE THE PAYMENT BY SWIFT MEANS:  Provide me with:  a). Name of your bank.  b) Address of your bank.  c) Bank Telephone and Fax.  d) Account Number.  e) Swift Code/Routing Number.  d)Account Names.  (2).OTHERWISE, IF YOU DESIRE TO HAVE THE PAYMENT BY CHECK:  Then, you do not have to provide your banking information. Simply provide me with:  a) Your full names (As would be on the check).  b) Contact/Mailing address  c) Your Telephone and Fax Number.  Furthermore, as surety for the money that would be paid to you on my behalf, I would need a scanned copy of your International Passport or Drivers License for record purpose.  When I receive all the aforementioned, I will then send a working AGREEMENT between you and I, to guide and guard this relationship.  Once all these are sorted out, I will notify the first company of my desire to receive my money through you and instruct them accordingly.  In conclusion:  I wish to draw your attention to the wise observation of Marlene Gill, who wrote:  "To exist is to change,  To change is to mature,  To mature is to go on creating one\'s self endlessly,"  As we continue to change and to mature as individuals and as a nation, let us continue to dream that one-day, very soon, Cholera and HIV/AIDS will no longer devastate our nation, that all of our young people will resort to responsible behavior and that the moral values of our forebears will once more dominate our society.  LET US DARE TO DREAM. For it is not an impossible dream.  This is simply from my heart to you.  I wish you the very best while giving my thanks in anticipation of a lasting business relationship with you.  Kindly send the requirements as mentioned above via my private email addresses as stated.  My regards,  K. M.

During the  course of our auditing we discovered the sum of (USD$9.7m)  floating in an account opened in this Bank since 1999 and as  from 2001 nobody has operated on this account again, and after  going through some old files in the records I discovered that  the owner of the account died without a [HEIRE]sept 11th 2001  by plane crash, hence the money is floating. After due verification I noticed that no other person knows  about this account except his wife who was also invovled in the  crash, and the account has no other beneficiary and my  investigation proved to me as well that until his death he was  the Director GOLD ARK [SARL] Since our Bank Arab Bank Plc Benin rep. got information about  his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come  forward and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the  deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and policies  but up to date nobody came up to this bank as his next of kin  or relative. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and  other officials in my department now decided to make this  businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the  next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and  subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming forth and we  don\'t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed  Bill.

I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/ business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. It is with trust that I wish to contact you on this matter concerning the transfer of US$30.5Million Dollars.  Sometime ago, a contract was awarded by my Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to an International Oil Firm, to Service, Turn Around Maintenance and Rehabilitation Work on Kaduna Refinery and Petrochemical Company (KRPC) Plant in Nigeria. This contract was over-invoiced by us (myself and two junior colleagues) to the tune of (US$30.5 Million United State Dollars). Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Key Tested  Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide.

We want you to present yourself as the Beneficiary to this fund, so that we can release the fund into your account for safety and subsequent disbursement. We have all modalities set.  We have been disappointed some years ago by a British, Mr. Rick Williams whom we trusted with a transaction of this nature up to the tune of US$50Million U.S. Dollars.

As, we are willing to try again with you believing in your good  cooperation and Faithfullness.

', 'PROPOSAL Attn:My dear friend  I am Dr Steve Uwa, the Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria, Lagos   Branch.  I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for   you.  On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil Consultant/Contractor with the Nigerian   National   Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed)   Deposit   for   twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00(Twenty- five Million   Dollars) in my branch.    Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address   but got   no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered   from   his   contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that   Mr. Barry   Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I   found out   that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next   of kin   to date has fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry   Kelly did   not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,   including his   Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is   still   sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the   principal   sum   at the end of each year.    No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law,   at the   expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of   the   Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently,   my   proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the   next of   kin   to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old man’s labor will not   get   into   the hands of some corrupt government  officials.    This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names,   address, telephone and fax numers so that the Attorney will prepare the   necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the   next of   kin. We shall employ the service of another Attorney for drafting and   notarization   of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of   probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will   then   facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of   kin.    The money will be paid into your nominated account for us to share in   the   ratio   of 60% for me, 35% for you and 5% to cover any accidental expenses on   either   sides during the course of this transaction.  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will   be done   by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the   successful   execution of this transaction. Upon your   response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant   documents   that will help you understand the transaction better.   Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this   transaction   would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your   assistance   to invest my share in your country. Looking forward to hearing from you   soonest.  Best regards,  Dr Steve Uwa.

I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank who perished with his whole families on 25TH JULY,2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [ Flight AF4590 ] with the whole passengers aboard.  There is an account opened in this bank in 1998 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a written or oral WILL attatched to the account. Since his death , I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it,the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of his company. The total amount involved is 106,000,000.00 USD.[ One hundred and six million United States Dollar ]. We wish to start the first transfer with $6,000,000.00 [Six million] and upon successful transaction without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account. I have secretly discussed this matter with the general manager of the bank who I must involve in order to have a smooth and a successful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are going to nominate. On this note, I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providing his/her bank account where the fund will be transferred for immediate investment on any viable project as no one has come up to be the next of kin. The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than six years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this long period of domancy.  In view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a reliable person who will be capable of receiving such amount in his or her personal account.At the conclussion of the transfer 65% of the fund will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process. Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you a detailed information about the transaction. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from the deceased.  When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail or you can call me or fax me VIA:  TEL:870} 763 648313, {870} 763 648314, FAX:(870} 763 648315.

I am Kolapo Omidire, company secretary and manager, internal and external services of COMMERCIAL BANK OF AFRICA. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank who perished with his entire family  (His wife and only son) in a plane crash (Korean Air Line 801) on August 6, 1997. Since the demise of this customer of ours , the bank management of COMMERCIAL BANK OF AFRICA has made valuable efforts to get in touch with any of the late customer's Next-of-Kin or relative anywhere in the world but  unfortunately, all our efforts did not yield any positive results as no one has come to claim his funds to the tune of Twenty one million, five hundred thousand united states dollars(USD21.5m) which has been with my bank all these while. Recently, the Federal Government of Nigeria directed that all funds not claimed (which has exceeded the stipulated banking period of seven years for such money) should be confiscated to the Federal Government Treasury Because the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than seven years.This means that this money will be recalled to the federal Government treasury as unclaimed after this period, precisely within this first quater  of this year. On this note, the chairman of the board of directors of the bank recently called me and told me in confidence and trust to source for a reliable foreigner who would stand as our foreign customer's next of kin. We (myself and the chairman) have reasoned that if we fail to collect this money the Nigerian government will confisticate it and someone else will end up looting it. Thats's why we have decided to contact you, hoping you will prove to be a reliable foreigner to stand as next of Kin to the deceased customer to claim the total fund from his account with the bank so that the proceeds of his account can be paid to you. Be assured that this transaction is risk free and we will do all possible to give it the legal and legitimate backing it requirs so that both parties will be protected from breach of the law both locally and internationally. Upon receipt of your response, I shall furnish you with the next step to take on how you shall prosecute this claim to your account. The entire transaction should be completed within 10 official working days from the day the bank receives your initial application. When you receive this letter, Kindly send me an e-mail signifying Your acceptance or otherwise, include your private Telephone numbers for more explanation and confidential communication.

I am Mr.Nze Moore from Arab Bank Plc,Benin Rep. During the  course of our  auditing we discovered the sum of (USD$9.7m) floating in an  account opened  in this Bank since 1996 and as from 1999 nobody has  operated on this account  again, and after going through some old files in the  records I discovered  that the owner of the account died without a [HEIRE] on oct  31 1999 by  plane crash, Egyptair flight 990,  (http://www.cnn.com/US/9911/02/egyptair990.list/)hence the  money is  floating.  After due verification I noticed that no other person knows  about this  account except his wife who  was also invovled in the crash, and the account has no  other beneficiary and  my investigation proved to me as well that until his death  he was the  Director GOLD ARK [SARL]  Since our Bank Arab Bank Plc Benin rep. got information  about his death, we  have been expecting his next of kin to come forward and  claim his money  because we cannot release it unless somebody  applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased  as indicated in  our banking guidelines and policies but up to date nobody  came up to this  bank as his next of kin or relative. It is therefore upon  this discovery  that I and other officials in my department now decided to  make this  businness proposal to you and release the money to you as  the next of kin or  relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent  disbursement since nobody  is coming forth and we don't want this money to go into the  Bank treasury as  unclaimed Bill.  On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be  used as the next  of kin as no one has come up as his relation. And the  country law here does  not allow such money to stay more than Five years, for the  money will be  recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this  period.  Upon the receipt of your response, I will send to you the  application form,  bank's contact and the next step to take. I will not fail  to bring to your  notice that this business is hitch free and that you should  not  entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can  be finalized  within five banking days, after you apply to the bank as a  relation to the  deceased.

That's why I contacted you.I am Mrs. Susan Martins the wife of Mr. John Martins of Zimbabwe.During the current war against famers in Zimbabwe and from the support of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country, all the white and black farmers were ordered to surrender their farms to his party members and his followers. My husband who was one of the best farmers in our country and treasurer of the farmer's Co-operation did not support his idea and so the party members invaded my husband's farms and burnt everything in the farm, killed my husband and made away with a lot of items in my husband's farm. After the death of my husband, my children and I decided to move out of Zimbabwe because our lives were in danger with the fund that my husband kept in his hidden safe in my house. The amount contained in the safe is US$30,5 Million (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) and we decided to move this money to the Republic of South Africa, where we deposited it with a private  Security Company as a valuables in a box/consignment. This I did for security reasons and to keep from public eyes.I have two options, firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction, or you can go into partnership with me for proper profitable investment of the money in your country.Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me.

However, in my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 30 m US  dollars  (Thirty Millon US dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our  foreign customer Engr. Lee Yung who died along with his entire family in  a concord plane  crash in the year 2000 in paris that almost took the whole life of the  pasengeres on board.Engr. Lee Yung was a contractor with the Federal  Republic of Togo, he supplied and installed equipment to some construction  companies in the country.  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next  of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all  his  supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash  leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery  that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this  businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin  or  relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody  is coming for it and we don;t want this money to go into the Bank  treasury as unclaimed Bill.  The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclamed after three years, the money will be transfered into the Bank  treasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of  kin  in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner  and an indigene of Togo cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.  We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in  respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for  expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for ;me and my  colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for  disbursement accoding to the percentages indicated.

In my department, I discovered an abandoned sum of US$13,500,000.00  (Thirteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account belonging to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in 1998 in an auto crash. This account was open with the bank in 1993 and since 1998 nobody has operated it. After careful investigation, I discovered that the owner of this account was the president of   MIRA CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LTD. Despite several attempts by the bank to trace the relatives/next of kin of the deceased, up to date nobody has yet come forward to claim the money. I later discovered that all his supposed next of kin died with him in the auto crash incident. I have spent the last five years monitoring the account and gathering necessary information and documents on it. Now that all papers are ready, I am asking for your assistant to release the money to you as next of kin or relation to the deceased for safekeeping and subsequent sharing.  The banking laws of Nigeria stipulates that such money, if unclaimed after five years of maturity, will be transferred into the Central Bank treasury as unclaimed effect.  The request for a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and presenting a Nigerian as the next of kin to a foreigner could raise concerns from the bank management.  I am ready to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. 10% will be used to pay off all the necessary fees/charges involved in the transfer. 25% will go to two other officials of Eagle Bank that are with me in this and whose positions will greatly help in expediting the transfer. I will be taking 45%. Please note that these figures are negotiable. After the money has been transferred to your country, I will visit your country for the disbursement/investing of my share according to the percentages we agree upon. Note this transaction requires utmost confidentiality and I am assuring you that it is 100% risk-free so you need not be afraid. I will not contact any other person until I am convinced that you are not interested.  Can you please send me your phone and fax number for safer communication when needed. Also please kindly note that all the money to finance this transfer will be provided and you will not be asked to contribute anything.

In my department, I discovered an abandoned sum of US$13,500,000.00  (Thirteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account belonging to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in 1998 in an auto crash. This account was open with the bank in 1993 and since 1998 nobody has operated it. After careful investigation, I discovered that the owner of this account was the president of   MIRA CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LTD. Despite several attempts by the bank to trace the relatives/next of kin of the deceased, up to date nobody has yet come forward to claim the money. I later discovered that all his supposed next of kin died with him in the auto crash incident. I have spent the last five years monitoring the account and gathering necessary information and documents on it. Now that all papers are ready, I am asking for your assistant to release the money to you as next of kin or relation to the deceased for safekeeping and subsequent sharing.  The banking laws of Nigeria stipulates that such money, if unclaimed after five years of maturity, will be transferred into the Central Bank treasury as unclaimed effect.  The request for a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and presenting a Nigerian as the next of kin to a foreigner could raise concerns from the bank management.  I am ready to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. 10% will be used to pay off all the necessary fees/charges involved in the transfer. 25% will go to two other officials of Eagle Bank that are with me in this and whose positions will greatly help in expediting the transfer. I will be taking 45%. Please note that these figures are negotiable. After the money has been transferred to your country, I will visit your country for the disbursement/investing of my share according to the percentages we agree upon. Note this transaction requires utmost confidentiality and I am assuring you that it is 100% risk-free so you need not be afraid. I will not contact any other person until I am convinced that you are not interested.  Can you please send me your phone and fax number for safer communication when needed. Also please kindly note that all the money to finance this transfer will be provided and you will not be asked to contribute anything. When I hear from you, I will send you an online banking access code with which you can log in to verify the account and balance using the banks online banking website.

However, I am Barrister Maxwell Obiekwu,the personal  attorney to the late Engr. Suk Hun Wufei, a Citizen of Japan, who used  to work with  Nigerian National Petrolum Co-operatrion (NNPC).  On the 26th of August 1999, my client,his wife and  their three  were involved in a fatal house explossion at  Nigerian National Petrolum Co-operatrion (NNPC)  quaters Lagos.  Unfortunately they all lost their lives including  other people in the premises.  Since then I have made several enquiries to several  Embassies to locate any of my clients extended  relatives, this has also proved successful.  After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided  to trace his relatives over the Internet to locate any  member of his family but of no avail, hence I  contacted you.  I contacted you to assist in repartrating the money  and property left behind by my client since I have no  place to locate any of his relatives. I can easily  convince the bank with my legal  practice that you are the only surviving relation of  my client.  Otherwise the Estate he left behind will be  confiscated or declared  unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposits  were lodged.  Particularly, My late client had an account with one  of the banks in Republic of Ghana valued at about  US$9.3Million (Nine Million Three Hundred Thousand  United States Dollars) which I witness the  documentations and the documents are with me.  Conseqently,The bank issued me a notice to provide the  next of kin to my client or have the account  confiscated within the  next twenty-one official working days since I have  been  unsuccesfull in locating the relatives for over  several years now.  I seek your consent to present you as the  next of kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of  this account  valued at US$9.3Million (Nine Million Three Hundred  Thousand United States Dollars) will be paid into your  account and  then you and I can share the money. 55% to me and 40%  to you,while  5% should be for expenses,tax as your government or  Replic of Ghana may require.  I have all necessary legal documents that can be used  to back up any claim we may make. All I require is  your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal  through. I guarantee that this will be executed under  a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from  any breach of the law.  Please get in touch with me by return email or call me on 234 80371  89723.

I found your contact while I was doing a private research on the Internet for a reliable and capable foreign partner that will assist my family and I. That's why I contacted you.I am Mrs. Susan Martins the wife of Mr. John Martins of Zimbabwe.During the current war against famers in Zimbabwe and from the support of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country, all the white and black farmers were ordered to surrender their farms to his party members and his followers. My husband who was one of the best farmers in our country and treasurer of the farmer's Co-operation did not support his idea and so the party members invaded my husband's farms and burnt everything in the farm, killed my husband and made away with a lot of items in my husband's farm.  After the death of my husband, my children and I decided to move out of Zimbabwe because our lives were in danger with the fund that my husband kept in his hidden safe in my house. The amount contained in the safe is US$30,5 Million (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) and we decided to move this money to the Republic of South Africa, where we deposited it with a private  Security Company as a valuables in a box/consignment. This I did for security reasons and to keep from public eyes.I have two options, firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction, or you can go into partnership with me for proper profitable investment of the money in your country.Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses that might be incured in the process of this transaction.  If you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you 20% of the total money, while 75% will be for my family. If you are really capable and willing to assist me as soon as you get this message please contact my son Wodi Martins immediately with the above telephone number (+27-732250444) or by email he knows also about this transaction. for details on how to execute this transaction to the satisfaction of everybody.  Finally I want you to know that your ability to keep confidential information about this transaction is very important as all our hope for a better life depends on this money.  Best Regard,  Mrs.Susan Martins  (For The Family) ", "Attn: The President/CEO  I am Mr. Fred Mende, Provincial Director Standard Bank of South Africa, Johannesburg Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 8, 1999, a foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. Richard Moss made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining Corporation that Mr.Richard Moss died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard Moss did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South Africa Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Richard Moss so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.  Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via my email:fredmende4@rediffmail.com Thanks and regards.  Mr.Fred Mende. ", 'safe keeping FROM: MR. SIMON OKOH.

We cannot release the funds from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.

Though this  approach  appears desperate, I can assure you that whatever  questions you would need to ask or any other thing you  will  need to know regarding this proposal will be  adequately  answered to give you a clearer understanding of it, so  as to  arrive at a successful conclusion.  My name is Dr Pimentel luisa Estrada, wife of His  Excellency  Joseph Estrada, former President of The Philippines.  My husband  was impeached from office by a backed uprising  of mass  demonstrators and the Senate and is presently in jail  on  trumped up charges of corruption, embezzlement, and  the mysterious  charge of economy plunder which might lead to death  sentence.  The present government is forcing my husband out of  Manila to  avoid demonstration by his supporters. As God would  have it,i realised some  reasonable amount of money from various deals that I  successfully executed, during my husband's regime as  President  of Philippines.

I am writing because when I deposited the money in the  deposit  company, I told them that it belonged to a foreign  business  partner and my present position will not allow me to  claim the  funds. Consequently, I will present you as the owner  of the  funds in the Deposit Company so you can be able to  claim the funds. This  is simple. I will like you to provide immediately;  1. Full names  2. Contact address  3. Telephone and fax numbers  Once I receive this information, I will prepare the  necessary  documents that will put you in place as the new owner  of the  funds.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for  this  transaction will be done by the solicitor and this  will  guarantees the successful execution of this  transaction.

Mr.Chan Fung  Manager of Land Bank,  Kincheng Branch.  6,Min Shen Rd,Kicheng Chen,  Kinmen Hsien, Fukien.Taiwan  R.O.C.  I am Mr.Chan Fung, Bank Manager of Land Bank,Kincheng branch,  Fukien,Taiwan. R.O.C.I have urgent and very confidential business  proposition for you.  On June 6, 1999, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese  Solid Minerals Corporation, Mr. Smith Lawrence made a numbered time  (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$30,000,000.00  (Thirty Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine  notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,  we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract  employers, the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr. Smith  Lawrence died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I  found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace  his next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Smith  Lawrence did not declare any kin or relations in all his official  documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of  US$30,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being  rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will  ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Republic of China,  at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the  ownership of the Chinese Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to  stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Smith Lawrence so that the fruits of  this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt  government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide  immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will  prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in  place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney  for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary  documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the  transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide  will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the  beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for  us to share in the ratio of 90% for me and 10% for you.  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will  be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees  the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested,  please reply immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your  response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant  documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me  your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.  Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall  require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting  your urgent reply.  Thanks and regards,  Mr.Chan Fung. ", "ASSISTANCE & OFFER !!!

These funds that were lodged in banks accounts in our country has been frozen. However, my family is not too comfortable with our present government as my late father was a very close aide of Charles Taylor, and on this backdrop the new government might decided to recall the frozen money back to the government purse, with exception of the US$8.5M(Eight million, five hundred United State Dollars)that was deposited in a Finance/security firm undiscovered uptil date. But due to the sanction place on my family by the International community i cannot reach this money myself or withdraw it back to Liberia for use. We have jointly decided within the family to relocate this funds outside Liberia for investment purpose.

Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address  but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we  discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian Institute of  Mining and Metallurgy, that Mr.Steve Warren died from an automobile  accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without  making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Steve  Warren did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official  documents, including his Bank Deposit documents in my Bank. This sum of  US$24,000,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping.  No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to the Nigerian  Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years,  the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody  applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that, since Mr.Steve Warren is a  Foreigner, I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of  the money which was fixed deposited in my bank.

CIRCLE ACCRA BRANCH, ACCRA-GHANA.  Beloved One,  Sir,  Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mrs. Monica Kofi credit  officer of the International Commercial Bank Ltd. (ICB) I have a  concealed business suggestion for you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our  client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also  business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with  a value of (US$8,000,000.00) Eight Millions United State Dollars only  in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during  the war early this year. Again after the war another notification was  sent and still no response came from him.  We later find out that the General and his family had been killed  during the war in bomb blast that hit their home. After further  investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not  declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work  of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at  my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank.  So, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still  lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What  bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at  the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the  Ghana Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this  backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner  to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be  able to receive his funds.  WHAT IS TO BE DONE:  I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we  shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will  prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin  to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa, all that is required from you at this stage is  for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the  attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of  kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and  secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for  the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.  There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a  Legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary  documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters  concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your  nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 50% for me, 40%  for you and 10% for the Charity/Motherless babies Home. Should you be  interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy  communication and I will provide you with more details of this  operation.

LOME-TOGO I AM THE MANAGER BILL AND EXCHANGE OF THE FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPARTMENT OF BANQUE TOGOLAISE DE DEVELOPPEMENT. I am writing you, following the impressive information about your profile through the website. Therefore, I believed that you shall posess the capability and reliability to champion this opportunity with me. In my department, we discovered an abandoned sum of 14 million US dollars (Fourteen million US dollars), in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in December,2002 in a plane crash. Since we got the urgly information about his death, we have been expecting his next of Kin to come over and claim his money because we can not release it unless somebody applies for it as next of Kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking and financial policies but unfortunately we learnt that his supposed next of kin or relation died along side with him in the accident leaving no body behind to claim the money.It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don�t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed bills. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred  into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request for a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and an indigene cannot stand as next of kin to the deceased family. We agreed that 20% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during this transaction and 75 % would be for me and my colleagues. Thereafter, I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. To enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged above, you must apply first to the Bank as the relation or next of kin to the deceased indicating your private telephone and fax numbers for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me on my E-MAIL as soon as you receive this letter. I decided to contact you as we have products of interest in your part of the world where we can invest our own percentage to avoid peoples awareness as we are civil servants. With your acceptance and cooperation, we can conclude this operation within ten working days. Please keep this very confidential. May God be with you. Yours faithfully, William Drallo.    __________________________________ Do you Yahoo!?

I am Mr.David Bongani the son of Dr. Simon Bongani,who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through the South Africa Informations Exchange (S.A.I.E) in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you, my late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority.    Before his death he had taken to Johannesburg -South Africa to deposit the sum of US$ 35.5 Million (Thirty-five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a Security and Finance Company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was depositedin a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.  This land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the "modus operandi" adopted by the government.This resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs.   precisely, More than thirty-one (31) people have so far been killed.Heads of governments from the west, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe\'s plan. Subsequently, South African Development Community(S.A.D.C) has continously supported Mugabe\'s new land act, it is against this background that I and my family who are currently residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Father\'s money into a foreign account.    As the eldest son of my Father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our family wealth and South Africa\'s government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history.More so, the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an "ASYLUM".    As a business person whom I entrusted my future and that of my family into his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter.For your assistance,we are offering you 30% of the total sum,60% for me and my family while 10% will be mapped out for any expenses we may incure during the course of this transaction.We wish to invest ourpart of the money on commercial property based on your advice.  Finally,all we demand from you is assurance that you will not sit on this money when it finally gets to your personal or company\'s account in your country.   If this proposal is acceptable by you, please confirm your interest via the above TELEPHONE number +27-83-424-7661or E-MAIL to the above address.  Best Regards.  David Bongani(For the Family).', "URGENT  LETTER  FROM SOLOMON MUDANI 3/5 RIDER HAGGARD CLOSE, JO, BORG SOUTH AFRICA.             {URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL)     (RE:  TRANSFER OF ($ 152,000.000.00 USD)      ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS  Dear sir/madam, We want to transfer to overseas ($ 152,000.000.00USD) One hundred and  Fifty two million United StatesDollars) from a Bank in Africa, I want to ask  you to quietly  look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable   and fit to provide either an existing bank account  or  to set up a new   Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to  receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end for  this important business trusting in  you and believing  in God that you will  never let me down either now or in future.

Yours, MR SOLOMON MUDANI.", 'Reply Asap Dear Sir,  I know this message will come to you as a big surprise because we have not met before, but please do not think this is one of those junk emails you received in your email box this is for real.  I am Rahim Sule I am the personal assistant to the late Mr. Alexander Murphy .my late boss Mr. Murphy spent all his live here in Lagos Nigeria. He is one of the richest contractors based in Nigeria before he died on 10th Jan 2000 together with his only daughter Kimberly in a motor accident.  the reason I am telling you these is because since Mr. Murphy died, a lot of letters and faxes has been coming to me the personal assistant to inform the next of kin to the late Mr. Murphy for the collection of $15 million united states dollars (fifteen million united states dollars) which is his balance for the road construction contract he executed for the Nigerian government.  But late Mr. Murphy has no next of kin; he died together with his only child Kimberly who is the next of kin.  I lived with him for 20 good years and he lost his parents when he was a small boy. Mr. Murphy generation is finished. But nobody knows his history apart from me the personal assistant he told me everything about his life before he died. So this is what I want the both of us to do immediately, I will present you as the next of kin I have all documents and files of the late Mr. Murphy which will cover you up fully as the next of kin.  The Contract Award Committee is waiting for me to inform the next of kin of late Mr. Murphy for him or her to contact the payment committee for them to release the $15 million United States dollars to the next of kin.  Anybody I present as the next of kin the money will be given to the person joyfully with my approval. It is only I the personal assistant that can produce the next of kin. This is a quick and sweet business if only you will cooperate with me there is nothing to fear in this business since I am involved.  The last letter the contract Award committee wrote to me yesterday was that if I cannot inform the next of kin, to contact them for the collection of the $15 million, that the funds will be sent into their government account and it will be used to purchase arms for their soldiers.  I am just coming back from their office before writing you this letter; I told them that the next of kin will contact them very soon for the collection of fund.  So I want the both of us to do this business together and collect the $15 million dollars when the fund is collected we must remove 10% of the total amount and give to charity homes then yourself and myself will now share the remaining equally 45% for you 45% for me.  Please do not tell anybody what I just wrote to you for security reasons and for the safety of the business.  Please if you will do this business with me send me your telephone number so that I can reach you.  I wait to hear from you as soon as possible.

Greeting:  After due deliberation with my children, I decided to contact you for  your assistance in standing as beneficiary to the sum of US$30.5M (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) First, let me start by introducing myself as MRS. SUSAN SHABANGU, a mother of three children and the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy since 1st April 1996 to date under the auspices of the President of South Africa MR THABO MBEKI.  You can view my profile at my Website www.gov.za then click on deputy  ministers, and then click on my name (shabangu susan.  THE PROPOSAL, after the swearing in ceremony making me the Deputy  Minister of Minerals and Energy, my husband Mr. Ndelebe Shabangu died while he was on an official trip to Trinidad and Tobago in 1996.  After his death, I discovered that he had some funds in a dollar  account which amounted to the sum of US$30.5M with a security and finance institution in South Africa of which I will divulge information to you when I get your full consent and support to go for a change of beneficiary and subsequent transfer of the funds into you comfortable and conducive account of your choice.This fund emanated as a result of an over-invoiced contract which he executed with the Government of South Africa.Though I assisted him in getting this  contract but I never knew that it was over-invoiced by him. I am afraid that the government of South Africa might start to investigate on contracts awarded from 1990 to date.  If they discover this money in his bank account, they will confiscate  it and seize his assets here in South Africa and this will definitely affect my political career in government. I want your assistance in opening an account with bankers through my banker so that this fund could be wired into your account directly without any hitch.  As soon as the fund gets to your account, you are expected to move it  immediately into another personal bank account in your country. I will  see to it that the account is not traced from South Africa. As soon as you have confirmed the fund into your account, I will send my eldest son with my Attorney to come to your country to discuss on business investments.  For your assistance, I am offering you 20% of the principal sum which  amounts to US$6,100.000.00 (Six million One Hundred Thousand United  States Dollars Only) However, you have to assure me and also be ready to go into agreement with me that you will not elope with my fund. If you agree to my terms, kindly as a matter of urgency send me an email. Due to my sensitive position in the South African Government, I would not WANT you to call me on phone or send a fax to me.  All correspondence must be by email to my private email address (sshbangu2002@yahoo.com} If you want to speak with my Banker, that is okay by me. You will have to send down you private telephone /fax number so that I can forward it to him to reach you from time to time this is for security reasons. Please I do not need to remind you of the need for absolute Confidentiality if this transaction must succeed.YOU MUST NOT CALL ME! If you do not feel comfortable with this transaction,  do not hesitate to discontinue. Thanks for your anticipated co-peration and my regards to your family.  Yours faithfully, MRS.

Yours truly William Mabaye', "Mr.Larry Edwards. Mr.Larry Edwards. Plot,1287 Port Shepstone  Ridder Hargerd Close,  South Africa.  Email:S_ed@consultant.com. Dear President/Ceo. We want to transfer to overseas the sum of One hundred and Forty Two Million United States Dollars (U.S.$142,000,000.00) from South Africa. I want to ask you to kindly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank account immediately to receive this money,though an empty bank account could serve this purpose as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business trusting in you and believing in God that you will never let me down either now or in time to come. I am Mr.Larry Edwards,the external auditor of a Bank.During the course of our auditing,I discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on this account again.After going through some old files in the records, I discovered that the owner of the account died without a �Heir apparent to the throne� hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account who is Mr.Gregory A.Williams,a foreigner and an industrialist died, since 1990,until now no other person(s) knows about this account or could give any documentary evidence concerning this account. As such this account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that Mr.Gregory A.Williams until his death was the manager Diamond Safari Company,in South Africa. However, if you are interested in this business we will start the first money transfer with Forty Two Million U.S.Dollars(U.S.$42,000,000.00) upon successful transaction without any disappointment from you. We shall also re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account. While the total amount involved is One hundred and Forty Two Million United States Dollars (U.S.$142,000,000.00)only.I would want us to make a first transfer of [Forty Two Million United States Dollar.(U.S.$42,000,000.00)from this money into a safe Foreigners account abroad before the rest. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local account, without valid international foreign �Agreement�, but could only be approved to any foreigner with valid international credentials: passport or drivers license and foreign account because this sum is in U.S. dollars and the former owner of the account Mr.Gregory A.Williams is a foreigner too,thus the money could only be approved into a foreign account. However, knowing all this, we will reach a binding agreement in this regards. As a matter of urgency, I will inform you the next step to take, while you Send your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit. I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding agreement that will bind us together before transferring the money to any account of your choice where the fund will be safe Before we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and investments,I need your full co-operation to make this business a success,because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you,upon your positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with the instructions of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business. I need your strong assurance that you will never let me down. With my influence and the position in the bank we can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing.And to build confidence that you can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which I will make this remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account.  I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that you are ready to act as directed.  To prove the authenticity of the business I will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries,foreign exchange departments, embassy and Board of Internal Revenue Services. At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total amount,60% will be for me,while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during this process.

Before his death he had taken to Johannesburg -South Africa to deposit the sum of US$ 35.5 Million (Thirty-five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a Security and Finance Company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was depositedin a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.  This land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the "modus operandi" adopted by the government.This resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs.   precisely, More than thirty-one (31) people have so far been killed.Heads of governments from the west, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe\'s plan. Subsequently, South African Development Community(S.A.D.C) has continously supported Mugabe\'s new land act, it is against this background that I and my family who are currently residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Father\'s money into a foreign account.    As the eldest son of my Father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our family wealth and South Africa\'s government seems to be playing along with them.

The money was depositedin a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.  This land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the "modus operandi" adopted by the government.This resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs.   precisely, More than thirty-one (31) people have so far been killed.Heads of governments from the west, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe\'s plan. Subsequently, South African Development Community(S.A.D.C) has continously supported Mugabe\'s new land act, it is against this background that I and my family who are currently residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Father\'s money into a foreign account.    As the eldest son of my Father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our family wealth and South Africa\'s government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history.More so, the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an "ASYLUM".    As a business person whom I entrusted my future and that of my family into his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter.For your assistance,we are offering you 30% of the total sum,60% for me and my family while 10% will be mapped out for any expenses we may incure during the course of this transaction.We wish to invest ourpart of the money on commercial property based on your advice.  Finally,all we demand from you is assurance that you will not sit on this money when it finally gets to your personal or company\'s account in your country.   If this proposal is acceptable by you, please confirm your interest via the above TELEPHONE number +27-83-424-7661or E-MAIL to the above address.  Best Regards.

The whole of  our  farmland amd  properties were destroyed by the mobs. The new land act reform which  affected the white and black farmers, resulting to massive killing by  war  veterans and lunatics in the society.  My husband died without leaving a word neither to me nor our only son,  but  his partner was rushed to the hospital where he later died after 2  days.  Before my husband partner died, he confided in me that he deposited  US$29,000,000 (Twenty Nine million united states dollars) in one  private  security company in Europe, that the money was meant for the purchase  of new  machineries for mechanised agriculture for the Zimbabwean farmers  movement  and new farms in Swaziland. He said that all I have to do is to source  for  an oversea partner who can be placed as the Beneficiary of the fund so  that  I and my son can have a new lease of life again. He made me promise  that  since he has no other leaving relatives, that I will not let money go  down  the drain.  I was later diagnosed to have cancer of the breast which resulted to my  losing one part of the breast to surgery. Presently, I am hospitalised  because my condition started deteriorating in a very strange manner. My  doctor gave me the saddest news of life as he told me that the cancer  has  spread to every part of my body including my liver. I have been boldly  told  that I just have a very short time to leave. As things are now, I am  not  afraid to die, but I don¡¯t want my son to suffer and I don¡¯t want to  let  late Mr.Bailey down by not having this claimed.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to  stand in  as the next of kin to Late Mr. Pete Bailey .This you can do by  corroborating  with my Kenneth who is currently seeking political asylum in Europe,  and our  family attorney to actualise this claim. I will request that you send  me  your personal details viz: Your full name and private home address,  your  telephone and fax number.this will enable the attorney to place you as  the  next of kin to late Mr.Pete Bailey.The sharing mode will be as follows.  1.30% of the fund will be for you  2.50% will be for my son which you will have to invest for him as his  guadian.  3.10% will be donated to the Southern African research center for  cancer.  4.While 10% will be set out for all the bills encured to conclude this  transaction including the attorney fees.  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will  be  done by the Attorney and with my support and endorsement I can  guarantee the  successful execution of this transaction.

Dear sir, I am MR, DIDI SITHOLE, the son of late MR.PATRICK SITHOLE, who was murdered in a land dispute in ZIMBABWE.I got your contact during my search for reliable&compitent foreigner to handle a confidential financial transaction, then I decided to write you. My late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of the ruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for his alleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean opposition party. Before the death of my father, he took me to South Africa to deposit the sum of Twelve million US Dollars ($12m) with a security and finance company, as if he knew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was deposited as a gem/precious stone to avoid much dumourage from the security firm. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new machinery and chemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. This land problem arose when President R. MUGABE introduced a new land Act. which wholly affects the White rich farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the \'MODUS OPERANDI\' adopted by the government. This resulted to rampant killing and mob actions. I and my family who are currently staying in South Africa as refugees or asylum seekers have decided to enter your name as foreigner/beneficiary of the Trunck Cases containing the Cash (USD12M) for futher transfer of the money to a foreign country where we can invest it. I am faced with the dilemma of claiming/investing this amount of money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have the same political history. Moreover, the South African monetary policy/law does not allow such investment hence I am seeking for an asylum or refugee. I must let you know that this business is 100% risk free and the nature of your business does not necessary matter. So if you are willing to assist us claim the ownership of this money,I and my family have agreed to give you 20% of the total money, 40% will be for a joint business venture I will be doing with you and another 35% will be for me and my family which we shall also invest in your country and the remaining 5% will be mapped out for all expenses we may incure during the transaction.

TELL:+27-732112866. Dear sir, I am MR, BONGO WALE, the son of late MR.PATRICK WALE, who was murdered in a land dispute in ZIMBABWE.I got your contact during my search for reliable&compitent foreigner to handle a confidential financial transaction, then I decided to write you. My late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of the ruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for his alleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean opposition party. Before the death of my father, he took me to South Africa to deposit the sum of Twelve million US Dollars ($12m) with a security and finance company, as if he knew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was deposited as a gem/precious stone to avoid much dumourage from the security firm. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new machinery and chemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. This land problem arose when President R. MUGABE introduced a new land Act. which wholly affects the White rich farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by the government. This resulted to rampant killing and mob actions. I and my family who are currently staying in South Africa as refugees or asylum seekers have decided to enter your name as foreigner/beneficiary of the Trunck Cases containing the Cash (USD12M) for futher transfer of the money to a foreign country where we can invest it. I am faced with the dilemma of claiming/investing this amount of money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have the same political history. Moreover, the South African monetary policy/law does not allow such investment hence I am seeking for an asylum or refugee. I must let you know that this business is 100% risk free and the nature of your business does not necessary matter. So if you are willing to assist us claim the ownership of this money,I and my family have agreed to give you 20% of the total money, 40% will be for a joint business venture I will be doing with you and another 35% will be for me and my family which we shall also invest in your country and the remaining 5% will be mapped out for all expenses we may incure during the transaction.

I have an urgent and very profitable business proposition for you that should  be handled with extreme confidentiality.  On January 6,1998 a Foreign  Consultant and contractor with the Nigerian  Water Corporation Mr. Marc Smith Pena by name made a numbered time Fixed  Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$40.9M(fourty Million, Nine  Hundred thousand United States Dollars Only) in my branch.  Upon maturity I sent a routine notification in accordance with the Bank  policy to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract  employers Nigerian Water Corporation that Mr. Marc Smith Pena died from  an automobile accident.  On further investigation, we found out that he died without making a Will  and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Marc Smith  Pena  did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents  including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$40.9M has been carefully  moved out of my bank to a Financial  and Security Company in Europe for safekeeping.  No one will ever come forward to claim it and according to the Law of my  country, at the expiration of 7 years the money will revert to the ownership  of the State (Government) if nobody applies to claim the fund.  We decided to contact you to receive his money and investments on his behalf  as everything will be taken over by the government as provided in section  129 sub 63(N), Nigerian Banking Edit of 1961.  This prompted us to contact you.We want to front you as the next of kin  of our late client thereby making you the legal beneficiary of the sum of  $40.9 million U.S Dollars that is presently in a Financial and Security  Company in Europe.  I contacted you because it is against the civil service code of ethics to  own and operate foreign accounts and your assistance would be needed to  claim the money in the Financial and Security Company in Europe,which also  has branches in Asia.  We have unanimously agreed that 35% of the entire sum would be for you if  you agree to take part in this profitable transaction,55% for me while the  remaining 10% would be used to pay back the expenses that may be incurred  during the course of the transaction by both parties after the fund has  been claimed and lodged in your account.  In the event that you are genuinely interested in the transaction, the following  information would be needed from you to expedite action.  1) Your Full Name .  2) Your Residential or Company Address.  3) Your Private Mobile,Telphone and Fax numbers where you can be reached  at all time because this transaction entails constant communication.

After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the Kenya Ministry of Energy that  Mr.Clifford Stone died from an automobile accident. On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Clifford Stone did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in  my Bank.  This sum ofUS$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever  come forward to claim it.

In the course of our preparation to host the World Youth Soccer Championship Tagged (Nig99) early last four years, huge sum of money running into millions of United States Dollars was budgeted by the then Military Government for the successful organization of this competition.   In the same vein, FIFA via its President, Mr. Joseph (SEPP) Blatter, made millions of dollars available for the same project, not to talk of Corporate Organizations and Football loving individuals who made huge donations.   However, in my capacity as the deputy secretary, to both the Local Organizing Committee (LOC), and the Nigerian Football Association(NFA), I,along with two of my colleagues in sensitive positions were able to over-invoice most contracts, which were awarded for the construction and the refurbishing of the 8 stadia used for the competition. The contractors who handled these projects have been paid-off.   It is pertinent to note that a total sum of thirty-two million United States Dollars(US$32,000,000.00) was realized as over-invoice after the successful completion of the project. This over-invoiced sum is lying in my organization's (NFA) suspense account with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), ready for transfer into the beneficiarys account oversea, waiting for the appropriate opportunity to do so. In this years (2003) budget speech, the new Civilian President has ordered that all foreign contractors debts should be paid in order to boost more Foreign investors into Nigeria. On this note, I have been unanimously mandated by my two colleagues to seek an honest and trustworthy Foreigner who will assist in ensuring the successful transfer of the above sum into a personal/company account since the Nigerian code of conduct does not allow us (Civil servants) to operate foreign accounts.   It is pertinent also to let you know that 30% of the total fund will be for you, while 10% will be used to settle any expenses that might be incurred by both parties and the remaining 60% will be for us (my colleagues and I) to be invested in your country. We have chosen you /your company to benefit with us in this transaction due to the respect your country commands here.  These are the necessary requirements we needed from you to complete this transaction:  1. Your bank Name, contact address and your account number where the money will be remitted.  2.Your bank telex, fax and telephone numbers.  3.Your personal phone/fax numbers for easy communication.  The above-mentioned particulars will be used to write LETTER OF CLAIM on behalf of your company from my ministry as the beneficiary of the fund.  You might be surprised and curious of an offer like this, be rest assured that the modalities and logistics towards the successful transfer of this fund has been worked out. All we require from you is your co-operation. This transaction is risk free.   We kindly request that you accord it the highest level of secrecy it deserves.

We are seeking your assistance to front as beneficiary of the said funds, More so, we are handicapped in the circumstance as the South Africa Civil Service code of conduct does not allow us to operate foreign account hence your importance in the whole transaction.  This amount (US$28.5m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance of the US$28.5m. which we have in principle gotten approvals from the Department of Finance and the contract review and payment committee to transfer by telegraphic transfer to any bank account you will provide. It does not matter whether you or your company does contract projects as a transfer of power and privileges with details & change of information upon application to reflect payment in favour of  you or your company will be secured on behalf of you or your company.

Compliments of the day,  My name is Paul Jacksoncole, I am a consulting auditor with one of the prime banks here in South Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my client bank who perished with his whole families on 25TH JULY,2000 in  CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [Flight AF4590] with the whole passengers on board.  During the course of my auditing work with my client bank, I discovered an account opened in the bank in 1998 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a written or oral 'WILL' attached to the account. Since his death, I  further investigated with keen interest to see if i can get any relative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO of his company.  The total amount involved is $36,000,000.00 USD.[Thirty Six Million United States Dollar]. We wish to start the first transfer with $10,000,000.00[Ten million] and upon successful transaction without any disappointment from your  side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.I have secretly discussed this matter with a close confidant attorney whom I must involve in order to assist us produce legal back-up documents which  would substantiate your claims and also enable us have a smooth and successful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are going to nominate.  On this note, I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providing his/her bank account where the fund will be transferred. The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than six years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury  as unclaimed after this long period of dormancy. In view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a reliable person who will be capable of  receiving such amount in his or her personal account. At the conclusion of the transfer 65% of the fund will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5% will  be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process.  Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you a detailed information about the transaction. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund  transfer can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from the deceased. When you receive this letter.  I look forward to your earliest reply through my private email address <mailto:mrp_jack@myway.com or pauljacksoncole@yahoo.com> and telephone number +874 763 593 620. Fax number +874 763 593 621.Just add your international dial out code number and you will get through.You should also include your private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe communication.  Respectfully Yours,  Mr Paul Jacksoncole.", "GOODDAY TO YOU!!! FROM THE DESK OF:  MR XIAO GANG,  BANK OF OVERSEAS CHINESE  TAIPEI,TAIWAN  Dear Friend,  How are you today and business in your country? I am Mr.Xiao Gang, Bank  Manager,Bank Of Overseas Chinese North Shyn Lin District, Taipei, Taiwan. I  would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail  confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a  result of this mail. I contacted you independently of our investigation and no  one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with  certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. I know you would be  wondering why I am writing you with a request such as this but I only urge you  to read on.  In November 1998, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese Solid  Minerals Corporation, Mr. Mark Kogan, made a Fixed Deposit  of the sum of  US$10,000,000.00 (Ten Million United States Dollars) which accumulated  to the  sum of US$20,160,176.00 (Twenty Million, One hundred and sixty thousand, One  hundred and seventy six United States Dollars for twelve calendar months in my  branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address  in America and Britain but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and  finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Chinese Solid Minerals  Corporation that Mr.Mark Kogan died alongside his wife, from an airplane  crash. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving  next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his  estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize  our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from  conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the  field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will know of  its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers  and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to  depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself,  ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they  nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not nominating next  of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; Mr.  Mark Kogan died interstate. In line with our internal processes for account  holders who have passed away, we instituted our own investigations in good  faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This  investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every  continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the  root of the problem. This sum of US$20,160,176.00 has since been sitting in my  Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end  of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to the Laws of Republic of China, at the expiration of 5 (five)  years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Chinese Government if  nobody applies to claim the funds. What I wish to relate to you will smack of  unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an  outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking  world aberrational. The world of banking especially is fraught with huge  rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios.  You should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I  propose. There is US$20,160,176.00 deposited in my bank, I alone have the  deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless evidence of  relationship with the deceased, which I shall provide you with, is presented.  I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as Bank of overseas  chinese is concerned, the bank's management has no single idea of what’s the  history or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting instructions to  release the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation.  This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man’s family;  they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation  has come to an end. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a  foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. mark kogan so that the fruits  of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt  government officials. Acting in this capacity really is simple, all you have  to do is provide your full names and address so that an attorney here can  prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as  the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and  notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary authentication, approval  and a letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer to be  done. A bank account in any part of the world that you then provide me with  will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next  of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share 90/10.  I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no  interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do  not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete  this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because  you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like  myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole  private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find  against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the  dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities  only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by,  for once I find myself in total control of my destiny. This is my chance and i  wont let it pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will  not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not  destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide my family  with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task  well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have  here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. There is no  risk whatsoever as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the  attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantee the successful  execution of this transaction. If you are interested in this lucrative role, I  urge you to indicate to that effect. Upon your response, if favourable, I  shall then provide you with more details and relevant information that will  help you get full understanding of the transaction. I will appreciate it if  you send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easier  communication.  If you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this email  address. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards  a conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official  channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not  want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you  contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through the  numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. My  official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to  assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management  Policy. Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am  a family man, I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a  measure of fear as to what the consequences may be, but I know within me that  nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy  or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have learned from my private  banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, we  should plan a meeting, soon.  In closing, please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that  this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall  require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Upon receiving  your reply, I will then furnish you with a more comprehensive detail of this  transaction and what is required of you.

ICEP is charged with the responsibility  of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss  indigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II.  It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's  Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by  non-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World  War II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims.  The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons  (ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant  accounts - 54,000 in December, 1999.  The published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including  interest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit  boxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts.  Numbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that  were interest bearing when established.  The Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims  on accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE  with a credit balance of 45,000,000 US dollar plus  accumulated interest  was discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust  era, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs.  The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all  unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing  credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by  the law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died  interstate (living no wills).  Being a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary  contacts for claim of the funds without any hitch. The funds will be  banked in the Holland Or London, being a safe haven for funds and  we can share the funds and use in investment of our choice.

Kindly provide me with your full name, address, and telephone/fax. I  will pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is transferred to a  secure, numbered account in your name in the Holland Or London, of which you  will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to  your country and other banks of choice in the world. My share will be 60  percent and your share is 40 per cent of the total amount. THERE IS NO  RISK INVOLVED.

During the course of my auditing work with my client bank, I discovered an account opened in the bank in 1998 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a written or oral 'WILL' attached to the account. Since his death, I further investigated with keen interest to see if i can get any relative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO of his company. The total amount involved is $36,000,000.00 USD.[Thirty Six Million United States Dollar]. We wish to start the first transfer with $10,000,000.00[Ten million] and upon successful transaction without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.

On this note, I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providing his/her bank account where the fund will be transferred. The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than six years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this long period of dormancy.  In view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a reliable person who will be capable of receiving such amount in his or her personal account. At the conclusion of the transfer 65% of the fund will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process. Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you a detailed information about the transaction. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from the deceased.

Mrs.M.Wusu ", 'moni_millat@tiscali.co.uk ATTN.DEAR,  My name is Mr Moni Millat a member of Independent Committee of  Eminent Persons (ICEP), Switzerland. ICEP is charged with the  responsibility  of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss  indigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II.  It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker?s  Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by  non-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of  World  War II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims.  The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons  (ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant  accounts -54,000 in December, 1999.  The published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including  interest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit  boxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts.  Numbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that  were interest bearing when established.  The Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims  on accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE  with a credit balance of 45,000,000 US dollar plus accumulated interest  was discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust  era, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs.  The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all  unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of  existing  credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided  by  the law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died  interstate (living no wills).  Being a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary  contacts for claim of the funds without any hitch. The funds will be  banked in the Holland Or London, being a safe haven for funds and  we can share the funds and use in investment of our choice.  Due to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim  the funds. All that is required is for you to provide me with your  details for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim  documents for transfer of the funds to you.  Kindly provide me with your full name, address, and telephone/fax. I  will pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is transferred to a  secure, numbered account in your name in the Holland Or London, of which  you  will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to  your country and other banks of choice in the world. My share will be 60  percent and your share is 40 per cent of the total amount. THERE IS NO  RISK INVOLVED.

Bank of Africa  Phone +226-78-86-11-06  Dear Friend  I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance  department of Bank of Africa Burkina Faso I am writing to seek your consent over a deal in my department.  In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$15.5m US dollars ( Fifteen million five hundred thousand US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 1999 in a plane crash.  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to th deceased as indicated in our banking gildings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the  plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that i now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.  The banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed after fours years, the money will be transferred into the bank  treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in  this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.  i agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in  respect to the provision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me.  Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated.  Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as  arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application . I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.  You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail  Trusting to hear from you immediately.  Your faithfully  Mr Jerry Moi  Bill and Exchange Manager.

Plot 1551 Richmond Avenue  G.R.A - Enugu  Dear sir,  TRANSFER OF $148,948,500.00 ON ACCOUNT NUMBER 262 -866-5050  I am contacting you in the belief that you are a honest and trustworthy person.I hope you will not betray the confidence I have in you to have contacted you even though we've not met before.Besides,I only got your address from an internet listing.I am Dr.Donald Ike,Head of Banking Operations,Eastern Banking Unit of one of the biggest banks in Africa.I will not mention the name of the bank I work for security reasons but promise to disclose it to you as soon as I am convinced that you are capable and willing to assist me with this transaction.I hope this does not turn you off anyway;I am only being cautious.  The account numbers mentioned above belong to late Engr.Philip De Wulf,a Belgian who was the managing director of Energy Services International ESI,a petrol and oil servicing company .This company has been a household name in the downstream s-ector of my country for its professional  service provision especially in the late 80s but after the death of Engr.Wulf everything began to take a rather retrogressive trend largely due to the inefficiency of his successor.  I personally manage the accounts of this company as well as the personal account of Engr.P.D.Wulf  .Shortly before his death in a ghastly motor accident which claimed his life and that of his newly married wife Mrs.Debra Wulf in 1993,I had received some receivables in the form of cheque payment on behalf of my esteemed customer,Engr.Wulf and since he instructed that all personal  cheques be paid to his online account,I followed the instruction to the latter.However as a result of his death,this account remained unserviced for a long time neither was there any person named next of kin .  The net balance of this account till date is One Hundred and Forty Eight Million,Nine Hundred and Forty Eight Thousand,Five Hundred United States Dollars($148,948,500.00).According to the Banking and Other Financial Act 1991 (as amended) of my country if such deposit is not claimed twelve years after the demise of the account holder,the Board of Directors should recommend to the Federal Authorites that efforts were actually made to establish the next - of -kin but due to non was specified by the deceased,that the Federal Government should inherit the account.The  actual fact on ground is that the directors do not return such money to the Fedeal  Authorities,instead they share and stach it in their foreign accounts amongst themselves.This should go far to explain why the bank is not making any effort in trying to locate any relation of this man for about a decade now but individual investigation conducted by myself shows that there is no information about his relations mentioned in any of the account opening documents filed at the bank.  All I want you to do is to collaborate with me by standing in as the beneficiary because Management is ready to approve the remittance of the money to any foreigner who has correct information of this account.Beside I would use my position to facilitate prompt remittance of the  fund.Send to me immediately the your business porofile as well as your bank account information of any bank of your choice where you want the money to be transfered.You may open a new account if you so wish.If for any reason you think you're incapable of this transaction, you may recommend anybody whose integrity is not in doubt. I shall however provide you with directives on what to do as we proceed.Contact me on my private e-mail address:(drikonsdonldez@post.cz) with information about your full contact addresses including your personal telephone & fax numbers and  Bank information immediately if you are interested. As soon as I get this information and I am convinced that you are capable to do this transaction,I will consult a probate lawyer on your behalf as the beneficiary for the drafting and notarization of the will and to obtain the neccesary documents and letter of Probate/Administration in your favour so as to put you in better position as the beneficiary .Please you have to be eraborate in your profile to enable  me make a good assessment about your desirability.I shall tell you the name of my bank soon after I am convinced of your personality.  I also need strong assurances from you to the effect that you can guarantee the safety of the money when it gets to your account.However,I want you to understand that as a man of strong character it beats my conscience that I have to do this deal for two strong reasons.Firstly ,to  curtail the excesses of the directors and secondly to plan ahead of my retirement which is just few months from now.In view of this,you may be approached after the transfer to provide me with investment advice as I plan to invest the fund in any lucrative venture after retirement.  At the conclusion of this business, I shall travel to your country for sharing.I have mapped out 30% of the total amount for you for assisting me,5% to take care of all expenses from both party and the remaining for me.  I await information about you and look forward for prompt reply from you.  Warmest Regards.

This Money totalling  the  sum of USD$126Million (One Hundred and Twenty Six Million Dollars), was  discovered when Auditing accounts in the Bank Of Commerce and Industry  also  known as the "United Bank for Africa Plc (Gabon)". It was during the  process that I got to discover this Money held in one of the accounts  with  the Bank.  My interest on this particular account started when I saw that the  account have  remained dormant since 1998, as nobody has operated on it since then.  My Investigation also revealed to me that the Money belonged to a  Foreigner  in Gabon: Mr. Alex C. Powell who was the Original owner of the Money and  who died in 1998 without writing a "WILL" therefore leaving nobody with  any knowledge or trace of the Money.  This is therefore the reason why I have contacted you so that you will  act as  the Beneficiary of the Money and receive it in your Bank account because  this money  can not be approved for Transfer to a local person here, without valid  international foreign passport, but can only be approved to any  foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license and  foreign Bank account because the money is in US dollars and the former  owner of  the account Mr. Alex C. Powell is a foreigner too, and the money can  only be  approved into a foreign Bank account.  We will start the first transfer with Twenty six million [$26,000.000]  upon successful Transfer without any disappoint from your side, we shall  re-apply for the payment of the remaining USD$100Million to your  account.

', "TREAT AS MOST URGENT FROM THE DESK OF:  MRS JULLIET ABRAMS  AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK  HEADQUARTERS  COTONOU  REPUBLIC OF BENIN.  I am MRS JULLIET ABRAMS, credit officer of African  Development Bank. I have an urgent and very  confidential business proposition for you.  In June, 1998, a British Oil consultant/contractor  with the West African's oil and Solid Minerals  Corporation, Mr. David Van Buskirk made a numbered  time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar  months, valued at US$35,000,000.00(Thirty five Million United States Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification  to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a  month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered  from his contract employers, the West African oil and  Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr.David Van Buskirk  died in an air crash along with his wife on the 31st  October, 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other  passengers on board.  On further investigation,I found out that he died  without making a WILL, and hitherto, all attempts to  trace his next of kin was fruitless. Mr.David Van  Buskirk was residing at No 1 Rue de Avenida, G.R.A.  Cotonou, Benin Republic.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered  that Mr.David Van Buskirk did not declare any kin or  relations in all his official documents, including his  Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of  US$35,000,000.00 is still sitting in my  Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the  principal sum at the end of each year. No one will  ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of  Benin, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money  will be declared frozen and forfeited to the  Benin Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a  foreigner to stand in as the next of kin or business  partner to Mr.David Van Buskirk so that  the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into  the hands of some corrupt government officials. This  is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your  full names and address,phone and fax numbers so that  the attorney will prepare the necessary  documents and affidavits that will put you in place as  the next of kin or business partner. We shall employ  the services of an attorney for drafting  and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the  necessary documents and letter of  probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world that you will  provide will then facilitate the transfer of this  money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.  The money will be paid into your account for us to  share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5%  for expenses incurred in the course of the  transaction.  We could also use an ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY in  Europe to secure this funds and transfer to your  account in your country.  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this  transaction will be done legitimately and with my  position as the credit officer guarantees the  successful execution of this transaction. If you are  interested, please reply immediately to  my email box.  Please send me your confidential telephone and fax  numbers for easy communication.  You should observe utmost confidentiality cum secrecy,  and rest assured that this transaction would be most  profitable for both of us because  I will require your assistance to invest my share in  your country.

Sorry receiving  this letter Since we have not known ourselves or met before.  Despite that,  I am constrained to write you this letter because of  the urgency of it.  By way of self introduction, I am Mrs Joy Afolabi, the wife of late Dr.  Sunday Afolabi Little did I know that my Late husband used his position  in the present government to influence the  Nigerian government to award  SAGEM S.A COMPANY (FRANCE)  the contract of handing the Nigerian national  identification card scheme in Nigeria of, which he and his colleagues were  then offered the sum of $214 million dollars by SAGEM as bribes.  Since my husband was a care-free person, he was poisoned by his colleagues  so that he will not get his share of the deal and later died out of shock  during his treatment abroad in Germany when he Finlay realised that his  case was as a result of poison, but thank God, my husband was smart enough  to have kept some wealth without letting anybody knows about it.  However, since after my husband death, we have suffered maltreatment and  untold hardship in the hands of my late husband's family, simply because  I did not bear a male child [heir apparent] for my  late husband. By tradition, all that my late husband had, [wealth] belongs  to his brothers/family. And myself is to be remarried by his immediate younger  brother which I vehemently refused. They have taken  all that I suffered with my husband to acquire including treasures, houses  and his bank particular seized by them. I wanted to escape to the United  States of America [USA} with my children on exile, but  again they conspired and stole my International passport and  other travelling  document to further frustrate me. My three daughters and I are trapped in  obnoxious custom and traditional norms.  Thank God, two weeks ago, I received Key Text Code from a Security Company  in EUROPE, that my late husband deposited U.S $15.5 Million cash in one  Security company in Europe. It has therefore become  very necessary and urgent to contact someone a foreigner like you to help  me receive/secure these funds overseas in a  reliable bank Account presumably  an empty Bank Account, if available and  to help invest it on our behalf  as well, while we find a way of getting out to meet with you in your country.  These funds are kept with one Security Company in EUROPE to avoid detection,  seizure or diversion.  I have had several communication with  the Director of the security company  in Europe, who has express willingness to help me on meeting the company's  demands.  This is why I have contacted you to help save my children and I By receiving  these funds on our behalf. But you need to give me Sufficient assurance  that you will not divert the fund if you help me.  My children and I have resolved to give you 30% of the total sum. This is  all my children and I have got to live on.  Please, I have reposed my confidence in you and hope you will not disappoint  me. I look forward to your urgent response, including your phone/ mobile  No and also your fax no for easier communication.  The secret codes (e.g Pin No, Secret Access Code)for this fund are safely  kept with me which I can give you as soon as you express desire to help  me.  Thank in advance for confidentiality and I look forward to hearing from  you.  Mrs. Joy Afolabi.

The documents were Deposit Bond Certificate of two trunk cases containing the sum    (USD18.5Million)  and sum family treasures which my father deposited in a security Financial   institution in europe with the name of my mother.  These Deposit Certificates and Bond of the cases were hidden in an underground  Cellar in the Mansion known only to my mother until my fathers death.Then my elder half-brother took over as the president, he confiscated all our late fathers properties including his bank accounts and other family  possessions.My mother was worse hit as she was driven out of the family house while I was declare wanted in the course of fleeing the  Mansion. My other was able to  smuggle the documents out of the cellar.  These papers she now asked me to run off to overseas and retrieve the  fund from the Security Company before my brother discovers about  the deposit.Presently I  have taken a temporal refuge in a neigbouring African Country pending my  getting assistance in moving this money to your country for further  investment.

Mobin Kabila', "REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE!!! Dr.Peter Akinjide  Ikoyi office complex,  Lagos, Nigeria.  Dear Friend,  I am Dr.Peter Akinjide,on behalf of my colleagues from different Federal  Government of Nigeria owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistance  as regards transfer of US$41,500,000.00 (Fourty one Million,five Hundred  Thousand US Dollars)into your bank account. These funds emanated from unclaimed  contractual proceeds of foreign contracting firms who could not meet their  financial obligations to their creditors. We, as holders of sensitive positions  in our various parastatals, were mandated by the Federal Government to scrutinise  all payments made to certain foreign contractors and we discovered that  some of the contractors have not been paid their contractual entitlement  which collectively left the sum of US$46,500,000.00 (Fourty six Million,five  Hundred Thousand US Dollars) lying in a suspended Account.  However,from our investigations,we discovered that the foreign beneficiary  companies have since been liquidated, and to all intents and purposes no  longer exist in Nigeria, thus providing us with this  opportunity,provided that we have a capable partner, to execute a transaction  of this nature.  We agreed that the said amount would be transferred into an overseas Bank  Account to be provided by a reliable foreign firm/associate. This is because  as serving Government workers the Civil Service Code does not allow us to  operate foreign Account. In our initial attempt to do  this,we succeeded in transferring part of this amount US$5m (Five Million  Dollars)into a United States Dollar Account in Beirut, Lebanon, but our  foreign associate failed to honour our mutual agreement insisting instead  that the total amount be transferred into the Account before we can share  the money.  As a result, we have lost confidence in the ability of our Lebanese partner  to see this matter to its logical conclusion,and until the initial transaction  is satisfactorily resolved,we have cancelled further transactions with him.In  the light of the foregoing,it is clear  that we require a partner that is not only capable of rendering assistance  and cooperation in executing this matter, but will honour the terms of agreement  when we reach the concluding stages of this transaction.  We therefore offer the amount of 20% of the entire sum in return for services/assistance  rendered in successfully carrying out this project.We trust that you appreciate  the sensitive nature of this matter and the need for initial caution on  our part, but when a relationship is confidently established and operations  commence you will be provided with all relevant information.  I remain at your disposal to entertain any questions/enquiries relating  to this proposition and you may contact me as a matter of urgency via e-mail  for further information on the procedures and requirements of this transaction.In  your reply, remember to indicate a safe telephone number where I can always  reach you. Hope to hear from you soon. Please treat with the strictest confidentiality  and expediency.  Yours faithfully,  Dr.Peter Akinjide  __________________________________________________________________  Tiscali Adsl 640 Free: fino al 15 novembre i consumi sono GRATIS!

My name is  Dr.Hilary Colsman, solicitor to the great Yengeni family in South Africa. Recently, my client's wife Mrs. Susan Yengeni took my attention to the  wide use of her husband's name by some impersonators/Scam artist to defraud  foreigners, claiming to be related to the family. Incase you had received such  email before now, from anyone else, please ignore the email and desist from  it now. She also revealed to me about her husband's funds that is been  deposited in a bank in my country. For your information: Her husband, Mr. Tony Yengeni was arrested and  charged to court for a multibillion dollar arms deal fraud, which was  politically motivated by his enemies as her husband was the chairman of parliament  in South Africa and the former chief whip of the ruling political party.  We had pleaded guilty in exchange for his acquittal on corruption charges  but were later convicted on trumped-up charges. This led to his bank  accounts in my bank and abroad being frozen. Now, as a matter of urgency, we need your assistance in the remittance  of the discovered funds abroad. The funds are currently deposited with a  bank in South Africa, which I will disclose to you upon my receipt of your  favorable response and consent in this deal. The amount is US$22.5 Million United States Dollars, which was deposited  by Mr. Tony Yengeni before his arrest. At the moment, the account is on  Dormancy, because no one has been operating the said account since his arrest.  All the account details and documents where also brought to me by his wife.  I hope you understand. You can find more about her husband?s predicaments at the following  websites: http://www.polity.org.za/html/govdocs/pr/2001/pr1003b.html http://www.go.za/projects/procurement/yengeni.htm http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1577682.stm http://www.hsf.org.za/focus22/focus22ethics.html http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2001/10/06/stories/0306000k.htm http://www.armsdeal-vpo.co.za/articles00/govt_reserves.html http://www.ifp.org.za/Releases/190303apr.htm Let me assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free.

We had pleaded guilty in exchange for his acquittal on corruption charges  but were later convicted on trumped-up charges. This led to his bank  accounts in my bank and abroad being frozen. Now, as a matter of urgency, we need your assistance in the remittance  of the discovered funds abroad. The funds are currently deposited with a  bank in South Africa, which I will disclose to you upon my receipt of your  favorable response and consent in this deal.

Please reply  Regards,  Mr.Amir Ebrahimi', 'Confidential Dear Friend,  I know you will be surprised to read from me, but please consider this  letter as a request from a family in dire need for your assistance.  Firstly, I must introduce myself, I am PRINCE IBRAHIM DUNGA from  Zimbabwe,  and I am the first and the only son of MR DANIEL DUNGA. I am presently  residing in SOUTH AFRICA.  I got your contact from the SOUTH AFRICA INFORMATION EXCHANGE (S.A.I.E)  in Johannesburg and on behalf of my mother who is a widow MRS ANGELA  DUNGA. I decided to solicit for your assistance to transfer the sum of  US$ 18.5M (Eighteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States  Dollars)  in your personal or company account. Before my father’s death, he was  among the few black Zimbabweans rich farmers, and, he was poisoned by  the agents of the ruling government of president ROBERT MUGABE for his  alleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean opposition party controlled  by white minority. Before his death, he had taken me to Johannesburg to  deposit his money to a Security and Finance Company. This money was  deposited as a gemstone to avoid much demurrage from the Security  Company.  This money was earmarked for purchase of new machinery and chemicals  for the farms and to establish new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.  In this will, he specifically drew my attention to this sum of US$18.5M  (Eighteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) that he  deposited in safe box of a private Security and Finance Company here in  Johannesburg, South Africa.  INFACT MY FATHER SAID IN HIS WILL AND QUOTE:   “My beloved son, I wish to draw your attention to this money which I  deposited in your name in a box with a Security and Finance Company in  Johannesburg, South Africa. In case of my absence on earth caused by  death, you should solicit for a reliable foreign partner to transfer  this  money out of South Africa for investment purposes.  >From the above, you will understand that life and future of my family  depends on this money, as much I will be very grateful if you can  assist  us. We are now living in South Africa as asylum seekers and financial  laws of South Africa does not allow asylum seekers certain right to  such  huge amount of money. In view of this, I can not invest this money in  South Africa hence am asking you to assist me to transfer this money  out  of South Africa for investment purposes. For your effort, I am prepared  to offer you 25% of the total fund. While 5% will be set my family and  I will keep aside for local and international expenses and 70%. Finally  modalities on how the transfer will be done will be conveyed to once we  establish trust and confidence between ourselves.  Looking forward to your reply including your full name, and your full  direct phone & fax numbers, and please treat as very urgent.  Best Regards,  PRINCE IBRAHIM DUNGA. ', 'Admin.Dept.  Dr.Morgen Akin Best Lagos-Africa Dear Friend, I, on behalf of my colleagues from the Federal Government of Nigeria  owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as regards  transfer of US$21,500,000.00 (Twenty-one Million, five Hundred Thousand  US Dollars) into your bank account. These funds emanated from unclaimed  contractual proceeds of foreign contracting firms who could not meet  their financial obligations to their creditors. We, as holders of  sensitive positions in our various parastatals, were mandated by the  Federal Government to scrutinize all payments made to certain Foreign  contractors and we discovered that some of the contractors have not  been paid their contractual entitlement which collectively left the sum  of US$35,500,000.00 (Thirty-Five Million, five Hundred Thousand US  Dollars) lying in a suspended Account. However, from our investigations, we discovered that the foreign  beneficiary companies have since been liquidated, and to all intents  and purposes no longer exist in Nigeria, thus providing us with this  Opportunity, provided that we have a capable partner, to execute a  transaction of this nature. We agreed that the said amount would be  transferred into an overseas Bank Account to be provided by a Reliable  foreign firm/associate. This is because as serving Government workers  the Civil Service Code does not allow us to operate foreign Account. In  our initial attempt to do this, we succeeded in transferring part of  this amount US$14m (Fourteen Million Dollars) into a United States Dollar Account in Beirut, Lebanon, but our foreign  associate failed to honour our mutual agreement insisting instead that  the total amount be transferred into the Account before we can share  the money. As a result, we have lost confidence in the ability of our Lebanese  partner to see this matter to its logical conclusion, and until the  initial transaction is satisfactorily resolved, we have cancelled  further transactions with him. In the light of the foregoing, it is  clear that we require a partner that is not only capable of rendering  assistance and cooperation in executing this matter, but will honour  the terms of agreement when we reach the concluding stages of this  transaction. We therefore offer the amount of 20% of the entire sum in return for services/assistance rendered in successfully carrying out  this project. We trust that you appreciate the sensitive nature of this  matter and the need for initial caution on our part, but when a  Relationship is confidently established and operations commence you  will be provided with all relevant information. I remain at your disposal to entertain any questions/enquiries relating  to this proposition and you may contact me as a matter of urgency via e- mail, for further information on the procedures and requirements of  this transaction. In your reply, remember to indicate a safe telephone  number where I can always reach you. Hope to hear from you soon. Please  treat with the strictest confidentiality and expediency.

I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.  On June 6 1998, a gold merchant/contractor with the  Randgold Exploration Company, Ms. Lori Vanwalters-Arvelo made  a numbered time (Fixed) deposite for twelve calendar months, valued  at US$6,500,000.00 (Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to her forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from her contract employers, Randgold Exploration company Ltd that Ms Lori Vanwalters-Arvelo died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that she did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace her next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Ms Lori Vanwalters-Arvelo did not declare any next of kin in all her official documents, including her Bank Deposit paperwork.  This sum of US$6,500,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will come forward to claim it. According to the South African Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Ms Lori Vanwalters-Arvelo so that the fruits of this old woman\'s labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin.  We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.  If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.  Awaiting your urgent reply via email.  Thanks and regards,  Thomas Dickson. ', 'CAN YOU BE SINCERE? HANG SENG BANK LTD. DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH, CENTRAL HONG KONG, HONG KONG.

If it does not interest you, discard the mail but if it makes sense to you, I open my arms wide to do business with you. I take liberty anchored on strong desire to solicit for your assistance on this mutual beneficiary and risk free transaction with you, which I hope you give urgent attention. To be precise; Your information were given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black Economic Empowerment Commission (Government) delegation on a trip to the United States during abilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties, and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of this business. Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work as the Director of Project Implementation, with co-operation of two other top officials, we have in our possession, an overdue payment in US funds.  The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$41,500,000.00 (Forty One Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed. The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe that private investment in general, and foreign direct investment in particular, are the real engines for sustainable economic development, for which reason it has continued to encouraged investment in the key growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere determination to pay foreign contractors all debts owed to them, so as to continue to enjoy close relationship, and mutually beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies. As a result we included our bills for approvals with the co-operation of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA).  We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign account.

The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$41,500,000.00 (Forty One Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed. The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe that private investment in general, and foreign direct investment in particular, are the real engines for sustainable economic development, for which reason it has continued to encouraged investment in the key growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere determination to pay foreign contractors all debts owed to them, so as to continue to enjoy close relationship, and mutually beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies. As a result we included our bills for approvals with the co-operation of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA).  We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign account. The changing of beneficiary's information/ details and other forms of documentation upon application for claim to reflect the contract money and its approvals will be secured on behalf of your company or yourself.

I am an Accountant and the chairman of the tender committee which  awards contract in the department of the petroleum Resources of Nigeria  . I sent you a letter by post office sometime ago informing you of our  plan to transfer the sum of US$20.5million (Twenty million, Five hundred thousand US Dollars only) to your account.  I have been waiting to hear from you,but up till now, nothing has been  heard from you hence this particular message. In any case, I guess that  you may not have received the letter after all due to the shortcomings  of our postal system. I want you to know that this fund originated from  an Over-invoiced contract sum which was awarded to a foreign firm in  1999.  I and my three (3)other colleagues in the tender Board purposely  inflated the actual cost of the contract to the tune of US$20.5Million.  However, the original contractor has fully executed the contract, the  project commissioned and the contractor paid his actual contract worth,  leaving behind the over-invoiced sum. So, itis based on this that we  now want you / your company to come forward to claim this sum on our  behalf. We are Civil Servants, and we are not allowed to operate  foreign account while still in office, so you are therefore to act as  one who had executed a contract worth the sum of US$20.5million for my  Department and you now want your payment.This deal is 100% risk free.  We  are perfectly in charged and had worked out modalities that would  guarantee a hitch free transfer of this fund to your account.

Our  investigations revealed no survival or NEXT OF KIN/RELATIONS for claims as  we have long been expecting someone to forward applications for claims as it  applies to our banking  regulations. Information / verifications from  reliable sources confirmed that his supposed ?NEXT OF KINS? died with him in  the crash. Hence this for your perusals. However, I kept this information (SECRET) confidential within my  jurisdiction to enable us submit claims and transfer this fund through  trustworthy person whom we shall present to our bank as the BONAFIDE ?NEXT  OF KIN? to the deceased.

My colleagues and I has resolved to offering you 20%  of the, total sum as commission, We will invest 75% of our share in your  country provided it is profit oriented. 5% of the total fund will be set  aside to re-emburse all expenses to be incurred in the course of  running  this transaction such as telephone and other minor expenses.

Hello Dear ,  I am EL.Gaily Maliky.  The Bank Manager of PACIFIC BANK PLC DAKAR-SENEGAL,Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.  On June 6 2000, a Chinese oil consultant / contractor with the SENEGALIS National Petroleum Corporation,  Mr. Chung Wyi made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at US$13,000,000.00 (thirteen Million Dollars)in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, SENEGALIS National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Chung Wyi died from an automobile accident. On further investigation,  I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Chung Wyi did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$13,000,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  No one will come forward to claim it. According to our Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the SENEGAL Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Chung Wyi so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt officials.  This is simple,  I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin.  We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate / administration in your favor for the transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world, which you provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary / next of kin.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and then the remaining 10 will be maped out for any expences done before or after the transfer.  As all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.  If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below.  Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand.  Please observe utmost confidentiality,and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.  Awaiting your urgent reply via email.  Thanks and regards,  EL.Gaily Maliky.  Manager Pacific Bank Plc Dakar Branch. ", 'GOOD DAY.

I am Mr. Cheung Pui director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have a obscured business suggestion for you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Bassem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home. After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Bassem  did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration of four years (4yrs) the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Bassem  so that you will be able to receive his funds.  WHAT IS TO BE DONE: I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Bassem ,all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.

Dear Sir/madam, I am Mr.Donald Gage, credit officer of IconShore Investment & Finance Bank.I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On June 6, 2002, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation,Mr.David Huckerby made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$28,000,000.00 (Twenty-eight Million Dollars only) in my branch.Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Hong Kong Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr. David Huckerby died from an automobile accident. On furtherinvestigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and allttempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.David Huckerby did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum ofUS$28,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to Laws of Iconshore Bank,at the expiration of 5(five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Federal Government,if nobody applies to claim the fund.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. David Huckerby so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% for expenses incurred in the course of the transaction.There is no risk at all,as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and with my position as the credit officer guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

I sincerely write to seek your co-operation and trust. >From the desk of  Mr.Donatus Okobi,  Email ;donatus_okobi@excite.com  Senior manager,  Bills and Exchange,  Nill Bank of Nigeria PLC,  Lagos, Nigeria.  Reply To: donatus_okobi@excite.com  Attn:   Dear Friend,  I sincerely write to seek your co-operation and trust to enable my  colleagues and I carry out an urgent business opportunity in my  department.  I work with the Nill Bank of Nigeria PLC; currently I am the senior  manager of bills and exchange at the foreign remittance department of  my bank. I was the account officer to one Mr. Ali B. Ashan who died  along  with his family on the 8th of November 1997 in an ADC Boeing 727  plane crash at Egirin River. All 141 passengers on board were feared  dead.  He left in his domiciliary account the total sum of $25.5m,{Twenty  Five  million, five hundred thousand USA Dollars}. Since the management  got  the information of his death we have been expecting any of his  relation  or his next of kin to come up and claim his money.  Unfortunately, From the day of his death till the time of this letter   none of his relation or friends has come up for the claim.The banking   and financial law of Nill Bank of Nigeria PLC stipulates that if such   fund remained unclaimed after a period of (7)seven years, it will be  transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. On this discovery  sir, I and two other senior staffs now decided to do business with you  and  release the money to you as the next of kin to Mr. Ali B. Ashan  for  safety and subsequent disbursement. I will soon proceed for my  retirement  leave this year, and I personally do not want this fund to  be  transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. That is why I  wanted the  fund to be move out of the bank before I proceed on my retirement from  the banking services by December 15th 2005.  The need for a foreigner as next of kin in this project is occasioned   by the fact that the customer Mr. Ali B. Ashan was a foreigner and a   Nigerian cannot stand as his next of kin or heir. We have agreed that  30%  of the Fund would be for you as foreign partner; thereafter my  colleague and I will visit your country for disbursement according to  the  percentages indicated.  To enable the immediate transfer of the fund into your nominated  account, you will first apply to the bank as the next of kin of the  deceased, indicating your bank account number and location where in the  money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your acknowledgement indicating  your interest, I will send to you the text of the application that you  will  send to the Nill Bank of Nigeria PLC authority for an approval to  submit  your claims. Send your reply through my direct and Private:  donatus_okobi@excite.com   Indicate your direct Fax and telephone numbers for effective  communication that this transaction needs. Do not reply through the  Nill Bank email address because it's belonged to the senior staffs for  public use.  Please note that you are not to appear in person, as everything  regarding this project will be strictly on documentations and every  banking  documents needed for this transaction will be taken care of by  myself.  Looking forward to urgently hearing from you.  Yours Faithfully,  Mr.Donatus Okobi PLEASE REPLY ME ON MY ALLTERNATIVE EMAIL:donatus_okobi@excite.com", 'Attention FROM:MR. CHEUNG PUI Hang Seng Bank Ltd Sai Wan Ho Branch 171 Shaukiwan Road Hong Kong. Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Cheung Pui director of  operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Sai Wan Ho Branch. I have an obscured business suggestion for you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war, our client Major Fadi Basem who was with the Iraqi forces and also a business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war two years ago. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later found out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home. After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration four years six months the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that you will be able to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE: I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favour for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for you . Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and I will prefer you to reach me on the email address below (cpui_hsbm01@mail2europe.com) and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this operation. Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Email: adamwinpoe@web-mail.com.ar Kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail to you.  Although we have never met before but I have every reason to believe that you are a highly respected personality, considering the fact that I sourced your profile from a human resource profile database on your country. Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile political situation in Liberia but it has formed insistent headlines in the CNN, BBC news bulletins, My name is Mr. Adam Winpoe from Liberia, a Country in West Africa. My Uncle is MR JOHN Y. WINPOE, former DEPUTY MINISTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY in LIBERIA. My uncle was falsely accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA (CHARLES TAYLOR) from office. Without trial, Charles Taylor killed him.  You can verify this from your country. You can also check in some of the international newspapers posted in the web sites below: http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-07-15- Liberia_x.htmhttp://www.unwire.org/UNWire/20030716/449_6621.asp Before he was killed, my uncle instructed me to escape with his family to a hide out in JOHANNESBOURG SOUTH AFRICA, and he confined on me that he left some money in a Diplomatic Trust Company in Abroad, (name withheld for security reasons) he handed me over a certificate meant for a secret Deposit, which he made in the Security Company. If you may ask why do I need a foreign assistance or why can't I take the cash transfer and myself? The answer is that there was an exclusion clause in the original agreement between the company and my uncle which states unambiguously that 'nobody, not even himself, can have access to the consignment in the company, and it has to  be transferred to a foreign beneficiary outside Africa. This was done because he envisaged   his arrest and this clause were inserted to prevent any seizure or infiltration of the fund. My decision to contact you is therefore, informed by this and due to my present social status and total ignorance of the business world. I believe you will appreciate the enormity of trust I repose on you by placing the fortunes of our family in your care. Permit me to request that you should reassure me that you would not let me down in any way. On my part, this is my assurance and guarantee to you. In as much as you follow my instructions carefully, religiously and promptly my guarantee of a hitch-free success remains unshakable. I have contacted the Diplomatic Security Firm to confirm the deposit, which is worth $21.5Million,(Twenty-One Million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars Only) which I presumed my uncle made from the purchase of arms and ammunitions for the Liberia Army. You will be given 20% of the total sum at the end of the transaction. If you will be willing to assist us claim the money and invest it in your country. I want to assure you that all modalities are in place and it is a risk free transaction. Kindly confirm in your reply if you can come over to enable us conclude this transaction.  Kindly include your Private Telephone and Fax numbers where you can always be reach, Your Residential or Company Address to enable me send some other important information across to you. This proposal is highly restricted and should be handled as an urgent transaction requiring trust and Confidentiality. Thanks while looking forward to hearing from you urgently. Thank you.

I presided over the award of the building of  the federal government satellite housing estates at here  in Dakar, the new federal capital city of Senegal.  During the bid for the contract, I had a pact with the  eventual winner of the bid and the contractor of the  project to inflate the contract sum to the tune of US$30  Million Dollars. The contract has since been executed, and  job completion certificate duly awarded. Furthermore, the  payment for the contract has been fully made to the  contractor leaving behind the over-inflated amount of US$30  Million Dollars, which I have secured under contract ref.  No: FMWH/FRN/108X01/2002.  The problem now is that as a senior civil servant, I am  prohibited by the civil service code from running a private  business or foreign bank account. Moreover, I am required  to declare my assets annually with the civil service  commission for verification and clearance, and therefore,  cannot defend this large amount of money as an addition to  my assets without compromising my reputation and the  impeccable records I have achieved over the years.  Therefore, I need your cooperation to be present as a sub-contractor  in the execution of the  project/contract to claim the fund on my behalf.  For volunteering your cooperation in this deal, you are  entitled to 40% of the fund. Should this be acceptable to  you, kindly indicate in writing and confirm the following:   Telephone and fax numbers for prompt communication.   Bank name, address and account number where the fund will   be moved.  Full name of company and address or personal name and  address that will serve as the beneficiary/sub-contractor  to claim the fund.  Furthermore, as soon as this fund is transferred into your  bank account, I will require you to still act as my agent  in investing my share in estates/landed properties and  financial securities in your country.  I want to emphasize here that this deal is free from any  form of risk from both parties as great care has been  exercise in perfecting it, and therefore, I enjoin you to  approach it with an open mind and without any fear  whatsoever. As a deal, I make haste to advise that you  should be private about it.

Attention Plz.,  My name is Mr. R. Lauder, a member of Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP), Switzerland. ICEP is charged with the responsibility of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss indigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II. It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by non-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims. The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant accounts - 54,000 in December, 1999. The published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including interest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit boxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. Numbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that were interest bearing when established.  Note, the Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims on accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE with a credit balance of 35,000,000 US dollar plus accumulated interest was discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs. The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by the law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died interstate (living no wills).  Being a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary contacts for claim of the funds without any hitch. Through well-secured channels,I have the ability to flit away the funds into a bank in the Cayman Island, being a tax free, safe haven for funds of this nature.And to further obliterate any atom of trace to the fund, once in The Cayman Islands,I will relocate the funds to France through same well-secured established channel.  Due to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim the funds from France. All that is required is for you to provide me with your details for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim documents for transfer of the funds in your name.And we share the funds.  Kindly provide me with your full names, address, and telephone/fax. I will pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is transferred to France securely, from where you will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to your country and other banks of choice in the world. My share will be 60 percent and your share is 40 percent of the total amount. THERE IS NO RISK INVOLVED.  You can find additional information about unclaimed funds through the internet at the following websites:  The Holocaust Claims Processing Office has put funds in Escrow awaiting submission of valid claims for necessary disbursement.

Dear Friend,   My warmest greetings to you. Firstly let me introduce  myself. I am Agnessa Vlachko, personal secretary to  Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man. Mr.  Khodorkovsky is Chairman & C.E.O Yukos Oil (One of  Russian's Largest Oil Company) and Menatep SBP Bank (A  well reputable Financial Institution). He was arrested  in October 2003 when masked and armed members of the  security police force stormed his private jet at an  airport in Siberia. Mr. Khodorkovsky was arrested for  his involvement in politics by financing the leading  and opposing political parties (The Union of Right  Forces, led by Boris Nemstov and Yabloko, a  liberal/social democratic party led by Gregor  Yavlinsky) which poses treat to President Vladimir  Putin.   In 2003, Sibneft (Another of Russian's Largest Oil  Company) and Yukos agreed to merge. Mr. Roman  Abramovich who controls Sibneft received US$3bn in  cash and a 26 per cent stake in the merged company in  return for his 92 per cent in Sibneft. Mr. Mikhail  Khodorkovsky my boss received the sum of US$106million  in cash. The stated sum was kept in a Financial  Institution here in Europe by me under instructions  from my boss. I was to make payment to an American oil  merchant on behalf of Mr. Khodorkovsky for his last  oil deal before his arrest.  There has been a bulk freezing of Russian Bank  Accounts linked to the Yukos Company that is why  foreign aid is required. Presently, the Russian court  has frozen the assets of Yukos due to an unpaid tax  claim during 2000 and the company may be forced into  bankruptcy. This is all an attempt by the Russian  government to bring about the total destruction of  Yukos and erode the personal wealth of Mr.  Khodorkovsky. Fear of arrest has forced all the firm's  top executives to remain outside Russia. I have  presently relocated to London. My boss has therefore  instructed me in confidence to look for a reputable  and capable individual who can assist us receive the  US$106million for safekeeping and subsequent  investment. All matters will be handled discreetly for  safety of the funds.   As personal secretary to Mr. Khodorkovsky, I have all  the necessary documentations to lay claim to this fund  on your behalf. You will be compensated with 10% of  the total sum for your partnership. You will be  required to stand as the beneficiary of the quoted  sum, while I arrange all relevant documents, which  will enable the European Bank release the sum to you.  Once I am convinced of your preparedness to assist in  concluding this transaction I shall provide you with  more details.

It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by non-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims. The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant accounts - 54,000 in December, 1999. The published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including interest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit boxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. Numbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that were interest bearing when established.  Note, the Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims on accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE with a credit balance of 35,000,000 US dollar plus accumulated interest was discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs. The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by the law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died interstate (living no wills).  Being a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary contacts for claim of the funds without any hitch. Through well-secured channels,I have the ability to flit away the funds into a bank in the Cayman Island, being a tax free, safe haven for funds of this nature.And to further obliterate any atom of trace to the fund, once in The Cayman Islands,I will relocate the funds to France through same well-secured established channel.  Due to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim the funds from France. All that is required is for you to provide me with your details for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim documents for transfer of the funds in your name.And we share the funds.  Kindly provide me with your full names, address, and telephone/fax. I will pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is transferred to France securely, from where you will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to your country and other banks of choice in the world. My share will be 60 percent and your share is 40 percent of the total amount. THERE IS NO RISK INVOLVED.  You can find additional information about unclaimed funds through the internet at the following websites:  The Holocaust Claims Processing Office has put funds in Escrow awaiting submission of valid claims for necessary disbursement. I find myself privileged to have this information and this may be a great opportunity for a life time of success without risks.

Dear Friend, My name is MR EMMANUL BRIGGS. I am a staff of CITIBANK NA, LAGOS-NIGERIA in Africa with our head office in USA. I work in the operations dept where I serve as account officer to numerous customers. One of the customers whom I worked as his account officer was a wealthy diamond merchandise. He lost his family, a wife and two children in a plane crash. Because this man was good to me when he was alive, I took it upon myself last month, to search if I could locate any of his close relations. But my efforts were abortive so I did not present any official report of my findings to the bank. Now there are two things I could do with regards to the dead mans money. First, as his accounts officer, I could formally notify the bank authorities that the man is dead and has no next of kin. In this case the money would be forfeited to the government treasury. As a matter of fact this is the proper thing I am supposed to do. Another thing I can do is to arrange for someone else, a foreigner, to act as the next of kin to the late man so that he will claim the money.  This is the option that I can do to help anybody and myself since the money actually is now a public fund due to the fact that my friend was a close ally to the late brutal military president that looted government treasury and that is why I have chosen to do it. I want you to be my partner in this deal. I will be investing most of my share into real estate business. All you would have to do is act as the next of kin of the dead man and the whole money in the account will be transferred to your account after due process.  As the accounts officer to the late man, I have certificate of the deposit of the fund here our custody and I will also through a local attorney that I will hire, secure all the necessary documents that will empower you legally to claim the money from the account. The funds will be paid to you as inheritance money. The total deposit made in the account is USD10.5 million.

RUE CLUB DE L' AMITIE, 0251 B.P. 1625 COTONOU, BéNIN REPUBLIQUE. My Dear Friend,   In Oder to transfer to overseas $28.5 million(USD) from GRAND FINANCE AND TRUST BANK,Bénin Republique. I want to  ask you to quietly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new  Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive this funds quitely. I am Dr.Joel Williams(PHD), the accountant/auditor of the above Finance Corporation in Cotonou,Bénin Republique  and personal confidant to Mr.Alvaro Quesada  of Dominican Republic in Caribbean Island who died in a Plane  Crash accident(2002-04-19) on his way to attend a weddind  ceremony together with his wife and only Child (Alvaro Jr). Mr.Alvaro Quesada, is From Dominican Republic in Caribbean Island, and a prosperous Tobacco merchant, he died in the year 2002  without having any beneficiary to his assets including his account  here in Bénin which he opened in the above stated bank in the year 2001 as his personal savings for the purpose of expansion and developement of his company in Africa before his untimely death in 2002.Until his death,he was the president  of the Dominican Tobacco Exporters Association. And from my Investigation,i found out that No other person knows about this account because he( Mr.Alvaro Quesada ) never knew that he is going to die so soon, and so his purpose was not achieved. If i don't remit this money immediately, it will get lost(may be it will go into the pockets of the corrupt government officials who will never use it for any reasonable thing at all). I dont want to miss this opportunity because it comes ones in a life time. The amount involved is $28.5 million(USD)Twenty eight million,five hundred United States Dollars and no other  person knows about this account. I am contacting you for  us to transfer this funds to your account as the beneficiary,  I want to first transfer $16,000.000.00(Sixteen million USD)   from this money into a safe account abroad, after which we will transfer the remaining (12.5M).  I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local person here, without a valid foreign international  passport, but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license and foreign a/c, this is because the money is in US Dollars and the former owner of the a/c, Alvaro Quesada is a foreigner too, and as such the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c. However,  I am revealing this to you with belief in God that you will never let me down in this business.I don't know you and have never seen you before,i only got your contacts from an international directory which my secretary provided for me. You are the first and the only person that I am contacting for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take. Send also your private telephone and fax number. I need your full co-operation to make this work because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you, upon your positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with instruction of a keybank official who is deeply involved with me in this business. I want to tell you that this transaction is 100% risk free and legal because all the documents that will back up this transaction will be available, so that no body will question the fund when it is finaly tranfered to your account. At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 40% of the total amount and 60% will be for me. I look forward to your earliest reply through this email. Thanks for your time.

CONTINENTAL BANK PLC LAGOS, NIGERIA Good Day, My name is James William, a Manager with the above bank located in Nigeria, West Africa. I have a proposal for your consideration and will be glad if you would give your co-operation so that we could exploit the opportunity together. The agent of an oversea penticostal church opened an account with our bank at the time of establishment some years back. The account is for the purpose of receiving support donations for the church. Curiously, this account was only operated for one year and abandoned. For the past years, donations have been pouring into the account from ignorant donors. I investigated and found out that the church opened similar bank accounts in many countries and as it grew, some of the accounts were abandoned especially in countries where the church had no physical presence. It was also discovered that some of the evangelist/agents overseeing the accounts were disgruntled at how church finances were managed and had to leave the church. I have been monitoring this bank account for some years; - from the time when there was only US$500,000 in the account to now when the account has over US$15Million. The interesting thing is that the donations are unanimous; so even the donors keep their identity secret. I and my top colleagues at the bank have agreed to treat this money as an abandoned account. They mandated me to source for a foreign partner to whom the bank could bequeath the money for charity. The financial laws of Nigeria is liberal in this respect as it permits the banks to bequeath such abandoned bank accounts to individuals or organizations that will use the fund for charitable courses. My reason for writing you is to solicit your co-operation so that you could be presented as the individual to whom this money will be bequeathed. We propose a 50/50 sharing arrangement between you and the CONTINENTAL BANK GROUP. If you accept, please confirm to me by a return email so that I can brief you on how we can harness this opportunity to our mutual benefit. You should also provide me with your telephone number to enable me call you. Accept my best wishes as I await your positive reply.

I am the wife to the late Mr. Jerry Agbeyegbe who was the Executive director  of the Nigerian Aviation safely initiative.  I am contacting you under a bereaved condition, I hope that you will treat  this mail with special concern and reply immediately as the need is very  urgent. My husband was murdered in the fee hours of Tuesday October 12, 2004  at the Alapere end of the Oworonsoki/Third Mainland Bridge, Lagos. You can  read the following journals concerning my husband's  death.  http://www.vanguardngr.com/articles/2002/cover/f214102004.html  http://www.businessdayonline.com/index.php?fArticleId=4912  He was buried on Friday the 3rd of December 2004.I have a different problem  now, apart from my husband's death. The future of my children and I, are  in serious danger, base on circumstances around the family in relation with  the tradition of my husband's home town. We are from Aja Ojobo, Ekurede Itsekiri,  Warri of Delta state of Nigeria. The tradition of this part of Nigeria, have  it that once a man dies, the family members, are entitled to all his assets,  including the wife and kids.  This very ackward tradition has caused a lot of problems between widows,  their children and the husband's family. I am married to a family of high  integrities and respected men in this society, who I can not face physically  in terms of problems over their late brother's assets. I am civilized woman;  I will not allow a rubbish tradition to rubbish our future. Seven days after  my husband's burial, I was called before the whole family to submit documents  of my husband, including his bank accounts to the family base on this barbaric  tradition.  Base on my late husband good intension for his children, I secured one thing  which will sustain us in life. My late husband made a wise provision to make  sure that in case of death, I and the kids will not face the barbaric effect  of the useless tradition.  My husband made a deposit of us$45million with  a finance firm in Europe. Like he used to tell me  when he was alive, He told me times without number that death is inevitable,  if he is no more for us, that I must make sure I protect his kids from any  failure to bring them up in the normal way both educationally and otherwise.  He advised me to make sure I do not let his brothers get to this deposit  in his absence.  He instructed me to seek for a good foreigner that will assist me secure  the money and assist us move away from this country build up a new life.  He charged himself while he was alive that our children must have the best  of educations in life. My husband made money while he was alive and our kids  should not suffer in the hands of the family for tradition sake. It is only  for this reason that he made this secret offshore deposit outside his family  knowledge.  Already, my late husband kept the documents of this deposit in the custody  of our lawyer friend in Amsterdam-The Netherlands. So there is no way the  family will get to know this. Please base on the sensitivity of this matter,  I will please plead you to keep this as a top secret. The air they said has  ears. We may not know who is by the side.  What I need from you is your full consent to present you to the financial  firm as the beneficiary to the deposit. In this way, the finance firm will  transact with you directly as the beneficiary release the deposit to you.  Once you retrieve the fund, you will keep the money with you until we arrange  for our coming over to meet you there in your country. When we come over,  we will look for a lucrative business to invest the money.  Every other arrangements concerning this, will be after you reply to this  mail, give me your full contact detail and phone number, and private email  where the need be.  I will gladly offer you a good percentage of the money  for your kind assistance.  Note that your immediate reply is needed so that I will not look for another  person.

Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,  the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr. John Lugard died from an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.John Lugard did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of 10,000,000.00pds is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the british banking law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of queen of England as royalty if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. John Lugard so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.

I am Mr. Cheung  Puidirector of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Sai Wan Ho Branch.I have a obscured business suggestion for you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Basem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United  State Dollars($24,500,000) only in my branch.

So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim  it.

This fund was a residue of the over invoiced Industrial Contract bills awarded by MINISTRIE OF FINANCE ECONOMICS COTONOU-BENIN REPUBLIC to some foreign firms.This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully protected with all the attendant lope holes sealed off.As the chief auditor,I have the cooperation and mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary. It was my consensus to seek the assistance of a willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to transfer this money out of West Africa.This is borne out of our beleive in the non-stable and sporous political nature of this sub-region.  The original contractors have been duely paid by the Banque Centrale Des Etats De L`Afrique De L`Ouest (Central Bank of the West African States)This balanceis suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by any foreign company of our choice.I intend to pay out this fund now as the organisation is winding up its activities. Based on the laws and ethics of employment,we as civil servants working under this organisation, are not allowed to operate a foreign account.This is the more reason why we needed your assistance to provide an account that can sustain this fund for safe keeping and our future investment with your comprehensive advise,assistance and partnership in your country.  I have however agreed,as the account owner in this deal to allow you 40% of the entire sum as compensation,why 55% will be held on trust for me while 5% will be used to defray any incidental charges and cost if any,during the course of the transactions. This transaction will be successfully concluded within 5-7 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due cooperation.You should provide the followings.

We hope to retire peacefully and lead a honourable business life afterwards. There are no risks involved.  Well, this is the sharing ratio of this $14.3M for both of us:- 1) I want you to know that my 55% from this fund $14.3M is: $ 7,865,000 :00. 2) While your own 40% from this fund $14.3M is: $5,720,000:00. 3) While 5% from this fund $14.3M for any expenses Made by you and me is: $7,15,000:00.

I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have a concealed business suggestion for you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home. After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.  Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds.  WHAT IS TO BE DONE: I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation.  Should you be interested please send me your full names, current residential address and I will provide you with more details of this operation.

Dear Sir/Madam,  You may be surprise to receive this letter from me as you don\'t know me in person, but please take this mail into consideration. I am Mr. Nicholas Kular, the son of   late Mr. JOHNSON KULAR, who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. Kindly work with me to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you, my late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority.  Before his death, he had earlier taken  to South Africa the sum of US$ 26.5 Million (Twenty -Six Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars)  which he deposited with a Security Company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was deposited in a box as VALUABLES AND PERSONAL EFFECTS to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company.  This money was for purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.  This land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the "modus operandi" adopted by the government. This resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs. Precisely, More than thirty-eight (38) people have so far been killed. Heads of governments from the west, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe\'splan. Subsequently, South African Development Community (S.A.D.C) has continuously supported Mugabe\'s new land act, it is against this background that I and my family who are currently residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Father\'s money into a foreign account. As the eldest son of my Father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing   our family wealth and South Africa\'s government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history. More so, the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an "ASYLUM".

I want to ask you to kindly look for a reliable and honest person who will  be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up  a new bank account immediately to receive this  oney,though an empty bank  account could serve this purpose as long as you will remain honest to me  till the end of this important business trusting in you and believing in  God that you will never let me down either now or in time to come.  I am Mr.Sam White ,the external auditor of a Bank.During the course of our  auditing,I discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in  1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on this account again.After going  through some old files in the records, I discovered that the owner of the  account died without a Heir apparent to the throne hence the money is  floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be  forfeited for nothing.  The owner of this account who is Mr.Eshed.B.Willey,a foreigner and an  industrialist died, since 1990,until now no other person(s) knows about  this account or could give any documentary evidence concerning this  account. As such this account has no other beneficiary and my  investigation proved to me as well that Eshed.B.Willey until his death was  the manager Oriental Diamond Company,in South Africa. However, if you are  interested in this business we will start the first money transfer with  Forfty Two Million  U.S.Dollars (U.S.$42,000,000.00) upon successful transaction without any  disappointment from you.

I would want us to make a  first transfer of Forfty Two Million United States  Dollar.(U.S.$4200,000.00)from this money into a safe foreigners account  abroad before the rest. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because  this money can not be approved to a local account, without valid  international foreign Agreement, but could only be approved to any  foreigner with valid international credentials: passport or drivers  license and foreign account because this sum is in U.S. dollars and the  former owner of the account Mr.Eshed.B.Willey is a foreigner too, thus the  money could only be approved into a foreign account. However, knowing all  this, we will reach a binding agreement in this regards.As a matter of  urgency, I will inform you the next step to take, while you Send your  private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account  to be used for the deposit.I want us to meet face to face to build  confidence and to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us together before transferring the money to any account of your  choice where the fund will be safe.sharing and investments.

I am married to Mr. Cletus John who worked with Liberian Embassy in Zambia for nine years before he died in the year 2003. We were married for eleven (11) years without a child and he died after a brief illness that lasted for just four (4) days. Before his death, we were both born- again Christians, since my husband’s death, I have decided never to re-marry or have a child outside my matrimonial home which the bible is against. When my late husband was still alive he deposited the sum of US$10,500,000.00 (Ten Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only) with a Security Company in Europe in my name and this money is still with the Security Company up till this moment. Recently, my doctor notified me that I have less than eight (8) months to live due to my cancer problem but the one that bothers me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition, I decided to leave this fund in Europe. I want an organization or an individual that will use this fund for orphanages, widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavour that the house of God is fully maintained. My Bible tell me that "Blessed is the hand that gives, I took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband’s relatives are not Christians and I do not want my husband’s effort to be used by un-believers. I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way, this is the reason I am taking this decision, and moreover I am not afraid of death because I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of our Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the Lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. Telephone communications will be minimal in this regard because of my health and also being fully aware of the presence of my husband’s relatives and my doctors who are always around me. I do not want them to know about this development for I know that with God all things are Possible. As soon as I receive your reply, I will inform the Security Company in Europe that you are the beneficiary of the said consignment and you will need to go and claim this fund in Europe. I will also issue you an authorization letter that will prove that you are the rightful beneficiary to the fund. I want you and your organization to always pray for me because the Lord is my Strength, Shepherd and my Help. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian and whosoever that wants to serve our Lord must serve him in spirit and in truth. Please always be prayerful for God is our source and once we are separated from our source, we are dead spiritually which automatically manifests in the physical. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for another person for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. If you want to talk by phone, you can send your telephone number by fax so that if my health permits me, I can call you or if you have message, you can equally call my doctor’s telephone number 00447040120051.

Mr Lewis Musasike Development Bank of Southern Africa. 1258 Lever Road Headway Hill, MIDRAND Republic Of South Africa. Email:lmusasike@dearriba.com Hello, I am Mr Lewis Musasike, General Manager(Treasury) of Development Bank of Southern Africa.This is an urgent and very confidential business proposition. On May 27, 2001,a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Mr.Kelvin Smith made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$10,500,000.00, (Ten Million, five hundred thousand Dollars). Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the National Petroleum Corporation that Mr.Kelvin Smith died from an automobile accident.On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Kelvin Smith did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$10,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it.According to South African Law,at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney.If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via my email Above. Thanks and my regards. Lewis Musasike. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ deArriba me paga por navegar.

I have a re-profiling amount in an excess of US$58M, which I seek your partnership in accommodating for me. I am willing to give out 25% of this total sum to you for your quick assistance and partnership, 70% for me and while 5% should be set side for reimbursement of any unforeseen expenses we both might incure in the cause of this transaction. However, I sincerely seek your confidence in this transaction, which I am proposing to you. My name is Robert Bada, I am the personal assistance to the former President of Republic of Liberia (President Charles Taylor). President Charles Taylor decided on the 11th of August 2003 to go into exile in a neighboring country Nigeria to seek asylum.  Based on these developments, his various foreign bank accounts have been frozen and some are still under serious investigation. But in the light of all these happenings, President Charles Taylor was able, through the help of some loyalist succeeded to secretly move the sum of US$58M, on my name as the owner to a private security company vault in Nigeria where the final crediting is expected to be carried out later. All the depositing documents of the above fund were on my name and they are still in my possession What I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum and I will arrange for the documentation which will enable the Security Company transfer / wire the fund to your bank account. I have decided to do this only with you and use this sum to relocate to European or American continent and never to be connected to any of President Charles Taylor's conglomerates. This transaction can be concluded within 2 weeks. My questions are:-  1. Can you handle this project?  2. Can I give you this trust?  3. can you keep this business as very confidential?  4.

You shall read more about the crash on visiting this website. http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/ http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because the Bank cannot release the funds unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to do business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safe keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed bill. We agreed that 20% of this money would be for you as foreign partner, while the balance will be for my colleagues and I. We will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account.

As soon as you receive this mail you should contact me by return mail whether or not you are willing to enter into this deal.

Dear Sir/Madam,  I am pleased to introduce a business opportunity to you to transfer to your overseas account a huge amount of money deposited in one of the Prime Banks here in Dakar-Senegal. I urgently want to know you and if you are capable of handling and accomodate this magnitude of funds until I resign and come over to join you for an investment in your country. What I need is a reliable and honest individual/organisation that would be capable and fit enough to provide either an existing bank account or set up a new Bank Account immediately to receive this funds. Even an empty bank account can serve to receive this funds as long as you will remain honest to me till we actualise this interest.  My name is Dr. Salif Mamadou, the Director of Bill and Exchange at the Foreign Remittance Department of the same bank. I am writing following the impressive information about you through one of my friends who runs a consultancy firm.

In my department we discovered an abandoned Sum of $18.5M USD Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars), in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers an American by name: Mr.Neal Walker who died along with other passengers in EgyptAir Flight 990 - October 31, 1999. We have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased and the person must be foreigner as indicated in our banking guidelines. Futher investigation, we discovered that the owner of the account died without a [Heir/WILL] hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in bank now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we do not want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury account as unclaimed fund.  The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and I can not stand as next of kin to a foreigner,it is also against our the banking law, guideline and ethics of banks here in my country. We have agreed that 20 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 70 % would be for me and my colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.

The above sum resulted from an over-invoiced contract, executed, commissioned and paid for about five years (5) ago by a foreign contractor. This action was however intentional and since then the fund has been in a suspense account at The Reserve Bank Of South Africa Apex Bank.  We are now ready to transfer the fund overseas and that is where you come in. It is important to inform you that as civil servants, we are forbidden to operate a foreign account; that is why we require your assistance. The total sum will be shared as follows: 70% for us, 25% for you and 5% for local and international expenses incidental to the transfer.  The transfer is risk free on both sides. I am an accountant with the Department of Minerals and Energy  Corporation (DME).

PETER WANG QIN STANDARD BANK SA E-MAIL: pet_wang@standardbanksa.net Dear Sir,                                    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL Greetings. This mail may come to you as a surprise but I plead with you to patiently read through it before making a decision whether to assist me or not. I wish to solicit for your assistance in the transaction which I strongly believes will be of mutual benefit to both of us if treated with trust and confidentiality that it deserve. My name is Mr. Peter Wang Qin, the branch manager of a reputable bank in Johannesburg, Gauteng Province, in the Republic of South Africa. I and two of my colleagues wish to seek your assistance in the transfer of some huge sum of money into a foreign bank account. This money was deposited seven years ago in a fixed deposit account in my bank by an Oil consultant/contractor with the South African Mining Corporation. (Name deliberately withheld for now) The length of time for the maturity of the fixed deposit was five years, which expired towards the ending of last year. Upon maturity, a routine notification was sent to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, a reminder was also sent and finally we discovered from his Contract Employers - The South African Mining Corporation that the Depositor died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that the depositor/beneficiary actually died in a car Accident here in South Africa, in May 2000 and he left nobody as next-of-kin to claim this money. All efforts made to trace any known relations of his proved abortive, and no one has written our bank in this regard. Hence, this said money is still lying in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. Now it�s clear no one will ever come forward to claim it. And according to the Laws of Republic of South Africa, at the expiration of 5(five) Years, the money will revert to the ownership of The South African Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. All modalities for the successful transfer of this money into an offshore bank account have been put in place and we are looking for a trust worthy foreign partner into whose bank account this fund would be remitted to and it is this regard that my colleagues have mandated me to provide a partner who will assist us. We have agreed to compensate you with 25% of the total amount if you should accept to assist us. If you are interested in giving us the required assistance, kindly reply this mail stating your Telephone/Fax numbers for further action. Because of the secrecy surrounding this transaction, l suggests that you contact me only through e-mail, until further notice. I am looking forward to a favorable reply from you soon. Feel free to ask any question in this regard. I remain, Yours Faithfully, Mr. Peter Wang Qin', 'MR LEONARD OKOBI AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT. FOREIGN OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT. NIGERIAN NATIONAL BANK .

My name is MR.MOSES  PARAISO,A top Management Official of the above Finance Corporation in Cotonou,  Benin Republic.  As it may intrest you to know, I got your contact through my international  business enquiry  as i was making contact of an foreign partner that will  assist me to bring this deal to be a success. I beleive you will be viable and  capable to champion a business of such  magnitude without any problem.  PROPOSITION: An Australian Engr Donald Pepper, a prosperous oil\\Gold merchant  had in our Bank the sum of $28.5million in a domiciliary account.  Unfortunately, he was killed in a recent ghastly motor accident in Benin  Republic. Efforts had been made by the management of my bank through the  Australian Embassy to contact any of the deceased children but to no avail. I  later discovered that he had no children. Given the skeletal information  available to the bank, it has so far been impossible to reach any of the  relatives.  The situation left for the Management is to declare the deceased account dormant  and revert the funds to trading for interest to the Bank. In order to avoid this  development, I now seek your approval to have you stand as a distant relative to  Engr Donald Pepper, so that the money would be released to you.  I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved  to a local bank here, but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid  international passport or drivers license and foreign account.  Because the money is in US dollars and the former owner of the account Engr  Donald Pepper,was a foreigner too.  All documents and proofs to enable you get the money will be carefully packaged  once I receive your acceptance on this proposal. I shall apply for a leave as  soon as the funds get into your reliable account to come to your country for  sharing and investments which you will assist me in doing.

PHONE NUMBER +229 - 05 17 26 ', '17 August 2005 FROM:MRS.MABEL NDLOVU ATTN: You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don\'t know me personally,but for the introduction,I am MRS. MABEL NDLOVU,the wife of Late DR.ONOMUA ANDREW NDLOVU who was recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe. I got your contact from the INTERNATIONAL TRADE CENTRE here in Johhanesburg and decided to write you.My Husband was among the few black Zimbabwe rich famers murdered in the cold blood by the agents of the ruling governmentof President Robert MUGABE for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party,controlled by the white minority. Before his death,he had taken me to to deposite the sum of Five Million Dollars US$ 5M.with a security and finance company as if he knew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was deposited in a box as gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new farm machinery and chemicals for the establishment of our new farm in lesotho and Swaziland.This land problem arose when president Robert MUGABE introduced a new land act,which wholly affected the rich white famers and some blacks vehemently condemned the modusoperand"adopted by the government. This resulted to rampant killings and mob actions by the war veterans and some political thugs presently,more than SIX-HUNDRED[600]people have so far been killed.Heads of government from the west,especially The Great Britain and The United states of America have voice their condemnation of MUGABE\'S plan.The South Africa development community (SADEC)has continuously supported MUGABE\'S new land reform Act.It is against this background that I and my Children who are currently staying as REFUGEE in a SOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC but currently seeking An ASSYLUM in any of THE THE WEST AFRICAN COUNTRIES have decided to transfer my late Husband\'s money into a foreign account. As the only and LEGITIMATE -WIFE of my late husband I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transfer without theknowledge of my country\'s government who are tatically freezing our familieswealthback home in ZIMBABWE and The South Africa government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the delimma of investing this amount of money in The South Africa Republic for the fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history.Moreso ,the South Africa Financial foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment hence I am seeking for Assistance.As a business person whom I must entrust my future and that of my family on his hands,I must let you know that this transfer is 100% RISK FREE . Therefore if you accept to assist my family,we are willing to offer you 20% of the total sum for your assitance,70% for me and my family,while 10% will be mapped out for all expenses.I would wish to invest in your country on REAL- ESTATE based on your advice and I would also receive assurance that you would\'nt sit on this money when transfered into your personal or company account. If this PLEA is acceptable by you please do send me your personaldetails,Name and Address,telephone and fax numbers .

I was the Permanent Secretary of Defense & Accounting Officer in Uganda. One of my reasons for contacting you is to share my joy with you that I have been exonerated and cleared by Hon Justice Julie Sebuntinde from the probe that involves three junk Chopper Helicopter purchased from Russia. My second reason is to ask you about the possibility of investing in your country that I believe we can embark upon together.   Due to the strong campaign by President Yowery Museveni to subdue the rebel forces of Joseph Kony in my country, directive was given in 1997 for the need to purchase some fresh arms and ammunitions abroad, which includes 3 MI-24 Chopper Helicopter Gunship that have night vision and anti-missile devices from Russian. When my superiors in authority concluded the negotiation for the purchases, I was told to prepare a ?contract? for the purchases of the Helicopters, which I did as the Permanent Secretary of Defence and Accounting Officer. It will amaze you to hear that after the Belarusian suppliers delivered the three MI-24 Helicopters to Uganda, inspection was carried out and it was discovered that the three MI-24 helicopters were junks. Further investigation revealed that Lt. Gen. Salim Saleh who is a younger brother to the President and his Aide-de-Camp (Mr. Ruyondo) connived with the Russian company to supply helicopter that are almost out of service (junks) and they were not overhauled for selfish financial   gains.   When Hon Justice Julie Sebuntinde probed the case, a report was released stating that The Chief of Logistics and Engineering, The Minister of State for Defence and myself have been exonerated and cleared from the offence.   Nevertheless, I lost my job and was prohibited from participating in public services.   PLEASE NOTE: In my long years of service to my country, I was able to acquire valuable fixed assets and substantial amount of money. Why the probing of the case was going on, I was advised by my Lawyer to sell off all my acquired properties that worth million of American dollars and also to withdraw my money from my bank account to save them from being frozen and confiscated. Due to the necessity for to lie low, I delegated power to my closest aide Mr. Steve Charles to be in charge of my projects.   The money realized from the sales of my properties was added to the money that was withdrawn from my account and the total amount was US$15,500,000.00 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Since I could not lodge this fund into any bank account for fear of being traced, the money was packaged and deposited with a Security Company that belong to a German national, based in South Africa for safekeeping. The funds are security coded and well packaged in a sealed luggage to prevent them from knowing the content. Arrangement is going on for the money to be moved from its current location to an affiliate security company in Europe by Mr. Steve Charles who is currently in europe to transact this business with you since I want my identity to be kept out of the money.   What I want from you at this moment is to indicate your interest and willingness to receive this money for investment purposes in your country. You are going to work hand-in-hand with Mr. Steve Charles whom is to represent my interest in this transaction, He is currently in europe. As soon as you receive this email, you are advised to contact him on his email address: stvchar1@netscape.net .He will let you know the modalities to claim the funds and also give you his phone number when you contact him. You will assist me in the investment of this money, but I will not want my identity revealed. I will also want to buy properties and stocks in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments with your assistance. At this point, I want to emphasise the high level of confidentiality, which this business demands and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence that I repose on you. l will render you 25% of this money and 5% will go for other expenses. . You ca   n also reach me true Mr Steve Charles   As you already know, time is of great essence in this transaction, kindly confirm your telephone and fax number  to Mr. Steve Charles. Bear in mind that this project can be concluded within five days if you are prompt in your response.   Kind personal regards,   DR. BEN MBOYE. ', "MR. ANDRE KOFFI REPLY ME BACK Dearest: Friend, My Name is Mr.Andre Koffi a credit officer with the one of the leading Bank (Finance Trust House) here in Cotonou Republic Du Benin. In my department i discovered an abandoned sum of (USD 32 m)  in an account that belongs to one of our foreigncustomer (MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany) who died along with his entire family in July 2000 in a plane crash. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479. stm Since i got information about his death, I have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after Five years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and an Indigen cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision of a foriegn account , 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business,another 5% to help the less previlage and to assist the charity organisations here in Africa and abroad while the rest 60% would be for me Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated . Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application .

President TAYLOR is being step down as the president of Liberia. He has resigned and seek asylum in Nigeria country due to pressures mounted on him by the international community especially the UNITED STATE OF AMERICA. My Brother has resign as president in order to give peace a chance in our country Liberia.  CHARLES TAYLOR has been a freedom fighter that fought all his life for the well being of Liberians. But due to the multi tribal nature of our country, REBELS From the enemy tribes have fought the ruling government of CHARLES TAYLOR, to the point where it has become impossible to maintain peace and tranquility. Presently we want to have some more time to relocate our wealth from Liberia to other foreign countries, where we can secretly invest our wealth profitably and peacefully. As of now, the president is now in NIGERIA where he is on asylum, the rest of our family including my three brothers and wife and children have left Liberia to seek refuge in foreign countries where they can have security and peace of mind. I am currently living in South Africa where I am living in asylum as a political refugee.  This is why I am writing you. On my arrival to South Africa, I come with the sum of US$18,000,000,00 (EIGHTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) This money was given to me by Ex. PRESIDENT TAYLOR to buy military arms and ammunitions from South African allies. These ammunitions were meant to be used to curtail the insurgence of rebel forces into the capital city of Monrovia. Ex. president Taylor therefore instructed me to find a reliable partner that will assist me to transfer this money to a foreign account for my personal use. Currently the money is deposited in a private security company here in South Africa as classified consignment. And the security company does not know the real contents of this consignment. I simply deposited the money as diplomatic valuables to avoid the security company from interfering with the money. I shall want you to help me transfer this money overseas.  I will appreciate if you can provide me with a bank account in a stable bank where we can transfer this money. I shall also want you to assist me in investing this money in any profitable venture for the future of my family.

I have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.  Your discreteness and ability to handle a transaction of this nature is of the uttermost importance.    Let me start by introducing myself properly to you.My name is  Mr Mike Charles Kobi, I'm the Son of late COL.

I came to know of you in my “private” search on the Internet for a reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. In brief, I have the sum of Nine million, two hundred thousands US dollars (9,200,000:00 U.S. dollars). This money was deposited by my late father in a high secured security company here in Dakar - Senegal, of which I was made the sole beneficiary along side with my aged mother.  Because of the present situation in my country sierra Leone, I decided to leave the country immediately because of some security reasons and also to look for a trust worthy and reliable person(s) who can assist us to transfer this money out of Dakar Senegal based on the agreement that was signed by my late father and the security company before his death.  As a Young Man, I pray that you being a kind hearted person(s) will surely help me to transfer this money to your country and also to assist in investing it in a profitable business which will yield more money.  I feel that I can confide in you , hoping that you will not betray me.    I have proposed twenty per cent (30%) of this money to you, so as for you to give all necessary assistance and protections we need in your country, 60% for us and 10% for the expenses which both will incurred as a result of this transaction.    Please treat as highly confidential because our future depends  on this money being the only thing that we have after running away from our country.    All the vital documents covering this deposit in the security company are with me here in Dakar Senegal and will be faxed to you on demand after I certify that you are worthy to do business with. The reason I searched for you importantly is because, based on the agreement made by my late father and the security company that simply stipulates that in case of his death, his money should be transferred out of Africa.     I would like to secure my money in your care as I have decided to order a command to the security company to transfer the money to you depending on your urgent reply to my request and my assessment of your person. Note that this transaction demands the highest trust and confidence between the two of us. Moreover, it is risk free in the sense that I have taken proper care of all formalities regarding this transaction.

Best Regards Dr.Paul Osadebe', "Mike Charles   Attn,    Greeting,  I solicit your confidence in this transaction that I propose to you. This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. I have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.  Your discreteness and ability to handle a transaction of this nature is of the uttermost importance.    Let me start by introducing myself properly to you.My name is  Mr Mike Charles Kobi, I'm the Son of late COL. JOHNSON KOBI (The assistant chief of general staff of sierra Leone’s revolutionary united front R.U.F) and at the crown Prince of kuloma village in the south – west district of sierra Leone; who died on the 29th of august 2000 with some of his colleagues during the war in my Country.    I came to know of you in my “private” search on the Internet for a reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. In brief, I have the sum of Nine million, two hundred thousands US dollars (9,200,000:00 U.S. dollars). This money was deposited by my late father in a high secured security company here in Dakar - Senegal, of which I was made the sole beneficiary along side with my aged mother.  Because of the present situation in my country sierra Leone, I decided to leave the country immediately because of some security reasons and also to look for a trust worthy and reliable person(s) who can assist us to transfer this money out of Dakar Senegal based on the agreement that was signed by my late father and the security company before his death.  As a Young Man, I pray that you being a kind hearted person(s) will surely help me to transfer this money to your country and also to assist in investing it in a profitable business which will yield more money.  I feel that I can confide in you , hoping that you will not betray me.    I have proposed twenty per cent (30%) of this money to you, so as for you to give all necessary assistance and protections we need in your country, 60% for us and 10% for the expenses which both will incurred as a result of this transaction.    Please treat as highly confidential because our future depends  on this money being the only thing that we have after running away from our country.    All the vital documents covering this deposit in the security company are with me here in Dakar Senegal and will be faxed to you on demand after I certify that you are worthy to do business with. The reason I searched for you importantly is because, based on the agreement made by my late father and the security company that simply stipulates that in case of his death, his money should be transferred out of Africa.     I would like to secure my money in your care as I have decided to order a command to the security company to transfer the money to you depending on your urgent reply to my request and my assessment of your person. Note that this transaction demands the highest trust and confidence between the two of us. Moreover, it is risk free in the sense that I have taken proper care of all formalities regarding this transaction.  If this proposal is acceptable by you, please do not hesitate to contact me Mike Charles Kobi by writing to the above mail address.You can reach me with my aternative mail at(macdani500@hotmail.com) You will have to send your most confidential Telephone/Fax numbers so that I can relay confidential information - as they will come in directly to you.  Thanking you in advance for your anticipated cooperation.  Expecting a reply.  Thank you. God Bless.  Yours Faithfully,  Mike Charles Kobi. ", 'From: Amah. (Urgent) FROM THE DESK OF DR. AMAH O.

Since his death, none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward to lay claims to this money as the heir or beneficiary.The bank cannot release the fund from his account unless a foreigner applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully worked out legally by a high court lawyer for the funds (US$28m) to be approved in your favour and transferred into your account as the beneficiary or next of kin to our late customer.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the Bank management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account,which I will give to you immediately,if you are able and capable to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust according to my instructions and advice for our mutual benefit because this opportunity will never come again in my life.

I,on behalf of my other colleagues from different Federal Government of Nigeria owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as regards the transfer of the above stated amount into your bank account. This fund arose from the overinvoicing of various contracts awarded in my parastatal to certain foreign contractors sometime ago. We as holders of sensitive positions in our various parastatal, were mandated by the federal  government to scrutinise all payments made to foreign contractors, and discovered that some of the contracts they executed were grossly over invoiced, either by omission or commission. Also, we discovered that the sum of $33,000,000.00(thirty three million American dollars only) was lying in a  suspense account, although the foreign contractors were fully paid their entitlements after  executing the said contracts.We all agreed that the over-invoiced amount be transferred into a bank account provided by a foreign partner, as the code  of conduct of federal civil service does not allow us to operate foreign accounts. However, we  have suceeded in transferring some of the monies, precisely US$7.5(Seven million five Hundred American Dollars) into a foreign account in united State of America,but unfortunately the provider of the account has severed all forms  of communication with us as he has refused to adhere to our earlier mutual  agreement, insisting that the total amount be paid into his nominated bank account  before disbursement will take effect. We are therefore seeking your assistance based on the balance amount US$25.5M which can be speedily processed and fully remitted into your  nominated bank account. On successful remittance of the funds into your account, you will be compensated with 20% of of the amount for your assistance and services.

My late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of the ruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for his alleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean opposition party. Before the death of my father, he took me to South Africa to deposit the sum of Twelve million US Dollars ($12m) with a security and finance company, as if he knew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was deposited as a gem/precious stone to avoid much dumourage from the security firm. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new machinery and chemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. This land problem arose when President R. MUGABE introduced a new land Act. which wholly affects the White rich farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by the government. This resulted to rampant killing and mob actions. I and my family who are currently staying in South Africa as refugees or asylum seekers have decided to enter your name as foreigner/beneficiary of the Trunck Cases containing the Cash (USD12M) for futher transfer of the money to a foreign country where we can invest it. I am faced with the dilemma of claiming/investing this amount of money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have the same political history. Moreover, the South African monetary policy/law does not allow such investment hence I am seeking for an asylum or refugee. I must let you know that this business is 100% risk free and the nature of your business does not necessary matter.

I then packaged the fund in consignments and deposited the consignments with a security/courier company.

Now, the security company believes that  what I deposited with them was Gold Bars.

Valuable effort are being made by the BANK to get in touch with any of the Monroe`s family or relatives  but there has been no success. It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any of the late Engr. Jacques Monroe  next of kin (he had no children that is known to us.)

I am a collage student of London School of Economics, U.K. I am compelled to contact you concerning a business deal,which I believe will be beneficial to you and I.  My father, His Excellency, Ambassador Krikor Tasharofi was a diplomat. In his lifetime, he  was an Ambassador emeritus. While in office, he was highly connected because  of his expertise in transferring money to coded accounts for important  Clients at short notices and without detection. Due to his  connections in  high places, at the end of his tenure as an Ambassador, he became acquainted  with important African leaders, politicians etc who  patronized him to help  them transfer money out of Africa and this he did with relative ease. I was quite close to him and was privy to his business deals because he used to confide in me. I was also aware of his numerous trips to Europe and theAmericas to make large cash deposits in several Banks. Recently, my  father came to England en route Liechtenstein to make large cash deposits  for one of his clients. We met on July 6th, 2005 at his hotel room and on  July 7th, 2005, I learnt that he was one of the victims of the London Terror  attack. After the recovery of his body, I and my other  siblings were making arrangements for his burial when on July 27th, 2005,one of the Embassy�s staff contacted me and informed me that my late father  took him  into confidence and told him of some boxes kept at the Embassy�s storage  house. The Staff also informed me that now that my father was dead,  he had  no option than to hand the boxes over to me. Upon collecting the boxes, I opened it and to my surprise, it contains large sum of money to the Value of US$84 Million US Dollars. I quickly close theboxes and left it there as the embassy storage house did not know  what is  the content in the boxes. My problem now is how to move this money  out ofthe U.K. into a designated Bank account. I have tried to use my late   father�s old routes to transfer it but met a brick wall and that is why  Ihave decided to seek for external assistance in the matter. I can assure you that this business is 100% risk free, as my late father�s Clients who owns the money would never suspect that I am involved.  For your assistance I will offer you 20% of the total sum, for your  assistance so please get back to me as soon as possible to enable me give  you the details on how we are going to proceed. 1: Full name 2:Direct telephone number and fax 3:An identification of you such as international passport /drivers license I eagerly await your urgent response to my private email.tasharofi-jnr@hotmail.com Yours truly, Luis Tasharofi JNR.', 'YOUR URGENT RESPONSE IS NEEDED Dear Friend.  My name is Mr. Fredrick Andrew. I trained and work as an external auditor for the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) of Singapore.

I have the courage to Crave indulgence for  this important business believing that you will never let me down  either now or in the future. Some years ago, an American Mining  consultant/ contractor with the Nigeria National Petroleum  Corporation,made a numbered time (fixed)deposit for twelve calendar  months, valued $42M.USD (FORTY TWO MILLION US DOLLARS) in an account.  On maturity, The bank sent a routine notification to his forwarding  address but got no reply. After a month, The bank sent another  reminder and finally his contract employers, the Nigerian National  Petroleum Corporation wrote to inform the bank that he died without  MAKING A WILL, and all attempts by the American Embassy to trace his  next of kin was fruitless. I therefore, made further investigation  and discovered that the beneficiary was an immigrant from Jamaica and  only recently obtained American citizenship. He did not declare any  kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank  deposit paper work. This money total amount$42M.USD ( FORTY TWO  MILLION US DOLLARS)is still sitting in my bank as dormant Account. No  one will ever come forward to claim it, and according to Nigerian  Banking policy, after some years, the money will revert to the  ownership of the Nigerian Government if the account owner is  certified dead. This is the situation, and my proposal is that I am  looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to  beneficiary, and OPEN a Bank Account abroad to facilitate the  transfer of this money. This is simple, all you have to do is to OPEN  an account anywhere in the world and send me its detail for me to  arrange the proper money transfer paperwork, and facilitate the  transfer.The money will then be paid into this Account for us to  share in the ratio of 60% for me, 35 % for you and 5% for expenses  that might come up during transfer process. There is no risk at all,  and all the paper work for this transaction will be done by me using  my position and connections in the banks in Nigeria. This business  transaction is guaranteed.And the first phase of the transfer will be  ($4M.USD) FOUR MILLION DOLLARS as advised by our insider in the  bank.If you are interested, please reply immediately through my  personal email sending the following details:  (1) Your Full Name/Address  (2) Your Private Telephone/fax Number.

I know you will be surprised to read from me, but please this letter is a request from a family in dire need of assistance. I am Mr. Ahmed Williams from Angola. The first and the only son of Brigadier Chanza Williams communicating to you from Johannesburg, South Africa. I got your address from a business directory in Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry. And, I, on behalf of my widowed mother Mrs. Bridget Williams decided to solicit for your assistance to transfer the sum of US$35.8 Million (Thirty-five Million Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars), which he deposited in a safe box to private security company in Johannesburg, South Africa. In fact, my father said, and I quote: ?My son, I wish to draw your attention to US$35.8 Million (Thirty-five Million Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). I deposited the box containing the fund in a security company in Johannesburg, South Africa as valuables. During the war, I was very committed and dedicated in winning the war against the rebels, until I found out that the senior army officers and government functionaries were busy helping themselves with government funds and properties, sending them to foreign countries. Due to this, when the former adviser to the president and I were assigned by the president (JOSE EDUARDO SANTOS) to purchase arms in South Africa, we saw this as a golden opportunity and diverted the money and share it, of which I got a total sum of US$35.8 Million (Thirty-five Million Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). In case of my absence on earth as a result of death, only you should solicit for assistance of a reliable and sincere foreign partner to assist you to transfer this money out of South Africa for investment purpose. I deposited the box in your name and you can claim it alone with deposited code. Your mother is with all the documents. Take good care of your mother and your sisters. >From this words of my late father, you can understand that life and future of my family depend on this fund, as such I will be grateful if you can assist us. We are now living in South Africa as political asylum seekers. Financial laws and regulations of the Republic of South Africa do not permit us certain financial rights. In view of this, I cannot invest this fund in South Africa hence; I am seeking your assistance to transfer this fund out of South Africa for investment purpose. For your assistance, we are prepared to offer you 20% of the total fund while 10% will be set aside for any expenses incurred during this transaction. Please note that this transaction is 100% risk-free and the major thing I demand from you is to assure me the safety of this money when it finally gets to you. Further information and arrangement commence as soon as trust confidence and good relationship are established. I shall be most grateful if you maintain the confidentiality of this matter.

Banking regulation legislation in Singapore demand that I notify the fiscal authorities after a statutory time period of twelve years when dormant accounts of this type are called in by the monetary regulatory bodies. The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing.I am of the settled conviction that using my insider leverage, working with you,since you have the same last Name with the Late Investor, we can secure the funds in the account for us instead of allowing it pass as unclaimed funds into the coffers of the Government of Singapore. This exactly is why I crave your participation and cooperation.  I have seized all relevant information (legal and Banking) that will facilitate our putting you forward as the claimant/beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated by you. Be assured that I and my colleagues are on top of the situation all the time and there will be no risk .  Needless to say, Uttermost CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if we are to successfully reap the immense benefits of this transaction.

I trained and work as an external auditor for the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) of Singapore. I have taken pains to find your contact through personal endeavours because a late investor , who bears the same last name with you has left monies totaling a little over $10 million United States Dollars with Our Bank for the past twelve years and no next of kin has come forward all these years.  Banking regulation legislation in Singapore demand that I notify the fiscal authorities after a statutory time period of twelve years when dormant accounts of this type are called in by the monetary regulatory bodies. The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing.I am of the settled conviction that using my insider leverage, working with you,since you have the same last Name with the Late Investor, we can secure the funds in the account for us instead of allowing it pass as unclaimed funds into the coffers of the Government of Singapore. This exactly is why I crave your participation and cooperation.  I have seized all relevant information (legal and Banking) that will facilitate our putting you forward as the claimant/beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated by you. Be assured that I and my colleagues are on top of the situation all the time and there will be no risk .  Needless to say, Uttermost CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if we are to successfully reap the immense benefits of this transaction.

Efforts  had been made by the management of my bank through the German Embassy  in Johannesburg  to contact any of the deceased children but to no  avail, as we were made to understand he had no children. Given the  skeletal information available to the bank, it has so far been  impossible to reach any of the relatives.       The situation left for  the Management is to declare the deceased account dormant and revert  the Amount to trading on behalf of the interest of the Bank. In order  to avoid this development, my Colleagues and I now seek your approval  to have you stand as a distant relative to Mr Wolfgang Schinister, so  that the money would be released to you. All documents and proofs to  enable you get the money will be carefully packaged once we receive  your consent on this proposal.       I shall apply for a leave as soon  as the funds gets into your reliable account to come to your country  for possible sharing and investment opportunity which you will assist  me in doing.

I am WILLIAM ZUNGU , the son of Dr. ZUNGU who was recently  murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through your  country�s Information Exchange in my search for a reliable and reputable  person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves a transfer  of fund into a foreign account and I decided to write to you. The war  veterans of the ruling Government of President Robert Mugabe for their  alleged support murdered my late father among the few black Zimbabwean rich  farmers in cold blood for the Movement of Democratic Change (MDC), which is  against Mugabe�s rule. The land problem arose when Mugabe introduced a New Land Act that wholly  affected the rich white farmers and some blacks vehemently condemned the �  modus operadi� adopted by the government. This resulted to rampart killings and mob action by the war veterans and  thugs. More than 78 people have so far been killed. Heads of Government from  the West, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their  condemnation of Mugabe�s Land Act. Subsequently, South Africa Development  Community (SADC) has continuously supported Mugabe. It is against this  background that my family and I who are currently in South Africa have  decided to transfer this money out of Africa as we no longer feel safe  anymore and want to transfer this money to a foreign country where we can  establish ourselves. Just before my father�s death, he took me to Johannesburg, South Africa to  deposit the sum of US$30.0000.00 (THIRTY MILION UNITED STATE DOLLARS) with a  security and finance company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe.  This money was deposited in a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from  the finance company. This amount was embarking for the purchase of new farms  machinery and chemicals, as well as the establishment of some new farms in  Lesotho and Swaziland. As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of  seeking for genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred  into without knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our  family�s wealth and the South African government seems to be playing along.  I am faced with the dilemma of investing the money here since both countries  have almost the same history. More so, the South African Foreign Exchange  does not allow such investments as I am seeking for asylum. As a businessperson whom I have to entrust my future and that of my family,  I must let you know that there is no risk and the nature of your business  does not necessarily matter. Therefore, should you be able and willing to  help me and my family, we are willing to offer you 30% of the total sum for  your assistance, 10% will be set aside for expenses we may incur while the  rest 60% will be for my family. It is our wish to invest our money on  commercial property based on your advice and I will also receive assurance  that you would not sit on this money when transferred into your account. If this proposal is acceptable by you, please confirm your interest via my  EMAIL.please i want you to include your private telephone number for easy  communication.

Sir/Madam  My name is Mr. Chin Weng Yin, I trained and work as an external auditor for the United Overseas Bank (UOB) of Singapore, working as part of a bigger team that covers the entire Asian region. I had taken pains to find your contact through personal endeavors.On routine audit check last month, I discovered some investment accounts that had been dormant for the least twelve years (Three tenures of four years each). All the accounts belong to a single holder with monies totaling a little above $10 million United States Dollars plus interest. Banking regulation/legislation in Singapore demand that I notify the fiscal authorities after a statutory time period of twelve years when dormant accounts of this type are called in by the monetary regulatory bodies. The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing and making the following proposing.  My investigations of the said account reveals that the investor died in 1993-the exact time the account was last operated. I can confirm with certainty that the said investor died interstate and no next-of-kin to his estate has been found or has come forward all these years. I am of the settled conviction that using my insider leverage, I, working with you can secure the funds in the account for us instead of allowing it pass as unclaimed funds into the coffers of the Government of Singapore. This exactly is why I crave your participation and co-operation. I have seized all relevant documents (legal and Banking) that will facilitate our putting you forward as the claimant /beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated by you. Of course you shall be handsomely rewarded for your part in this transaction as the people I am working with are prepared to allocate a 20% slice of the total funds for your efforts.

With our positions, we have  successfully secured for ourselves the sum of twenty-seven million five  hundred thousand united states dollars ($27.5m).  The present  government in my country are seeking the support of foreign  governments, so they gave directive to all federal parastatals to  compile and settle all foreign contractors being owned for contract  that has been executed, so our plan is to include the name that you  will provide us, as one of the contractors being owed in my  corporation, the Nigerian national petroleum corporation (NNPC).  What  we need from you is (1) a company name or a name of which to use as the  company that did execute the contract (2) an account even if empty into  which the fund will be transferred, this is because our code of conduct  prohibits government officials from operation or owning foreign  account.

He actually made a numbered time (fixed)deposit valued at US$112,000,000.00  (One Hundred and Twelve million united states dollars),for twelve calendar  months in my bank.The funds was actually meant for a project our late client wanted to start in the near future (a multi million Dollar steel plant in Canada), I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally we discovered that Mr.Cosban died from an automobile accident with his entire family .On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Cosban did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in our Bank. Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully worked out by me for the funds to be released in your favour as the beneficiary's next of kin.

WEST AFRICA. Dear Friend, I Mr.Sami mohammad the Chairman of  Contract Awarding Committee of  the EUROPEAN UNION CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT(ECC)  in BURKINA FASO West Africa. I got your information in a business directory from the Burkina Faso Chamber of Commerce and ndustries, when I was searching for a reliable, honest and trust worthy person to entrust this business with. I was simply inspired and  motivated to pick your contact from the directory. After discussing my  view and your profile with my colleagues, they were very much satisfied and decided to contact you immediately for this mutual business relationship. We wish to transfer the sum of USD$36.000,000.00 (Thirty Six million United States Dollars only.) into your personal or company's bank account. This fund was a residue of the over invoiced contract bills awarded by us for the supply of  equiment,hard/soft  wares, pharmaceuticals/medical items relating to constructing tool's, light and heavy duty vehicles, apparels and other administrative logistics etc for the Burkina Faso Projects. This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully protected with all the attendant loop holes sealed off. As the Chairman of CAC, I have the cooperation and mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary of the Organisation. We arranged and over invoiced the contract funds supplied by different companies from different countries. It was our consensus to seek the assistance of a willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to transfer this money out of Burkina Faso.<  /STRONG> This is borne out of our belief in the non-stable and sporous political nature of this sub-egion.The original contractors have been duly paid by the Bank of Africa Ouaga-Burkina-Faso in West Africa. (Bank of Africa, Ouaga-Burkina-Faso in West Africa). Through our bankers - Societe  Generale  Banque. This balance is suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by any foreign company of our choice. We intend to pay out this fund NOW as the organization is winding up its activities and the coast has been achieved.  Based on the laws and ethics of employment, we as civil servants working under this organization, are not allowed to operate a foreign account. This is the more reason why we needed your assistance to provide an account that can sustain this fund for safe keeping and our future investment with your comprehensive advise, assistance and partnership in your country.It is however agreed, as the account owner in this deal to allow you 30% of the entire sum as compensation, 60% will be held on trust for us while 10% will be used to defray any incidental charges and cost during the course of the transaction. This transaction will be successfully concluded within 14 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due cooperation.

I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money left behind by my client before it is confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this deposit valued at 45 million dollars is lodged. This bank has issued me a notice to contact the next of kin, or the account will be confiscated because there is a government gazzette/mandate/authorising all banks to freeze or consificate any account that has not been servicable in a long period of time, this is geared towards capital flight for the economy. My proposition to you is to seek your consent to present you as the next-of-kin and beneficiary of my named client, so that the proceeds of this account can be paid to you, then we can share the amount on a mutually agreed-upon percentage. All legal documents to back up your claim as my client's next-of-kin will be provided. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this transaction through. This will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.

The owner of this account is Mr.   Morris Thompson, a foreigner, Business Man and a miner at Kruger Gold   Company, a Geologist by profession and he died since 2000. Ever then no   other person knows this account or anything concerning it, the account has   no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this   company does not know anything about this account and the money involved is   One hundred and Thirty Six Million United States Dollars (US$ 136 Million).    I want  us to first transfer US$ 36 Million from this money into your safe  overseas account before the rest.

George Egobia Telephone:+229 97 98 99 63. Due to your good nature with others,I want to propose a very interesting  deal to you. I work with Deposit Trust House,a Security and Trust company in Republic  of Benin,West Africa,as the operations manager. Actually,there is one very big customer of our company,he is an american  by name Elijah Miller,he had $252,000,000.00(two hundred and fifty two  million)united states dollars with our company and I was his  representative in our company. Last three months he came and collected $2,000,000.00(two million dollars) cash and said if he arrives in his country he was going to send us his  banking details,so that we can remit his remaining balance of  $250,000,000.00.But I have not heard from him since then. Just three weeks ago his secretary that he came with to our  company,called me and said Mr. Elijah had instructed her to send me the  bank account were we are to remit the remaining $250million,because he (elijah) was sick.She sent me all the necessary confidential documents  and said Elijah gave it to her,so there was nothing we could do but to  start remittance of the fund bit by bit. But before we started remitting the money,I called Elijah's line and his  wife picked up the phone and to my greatest surprise,she said Elijah had  died in a car crash a month ago.That was when I understood that the  secretary must have stolen all those documents from his office vault  immediately he died and she is now claiming the funds on his behalf,but I  kept quite so that I can also get my share. I have made a perfect plan with the remittance director,who is my only  partner in this deal because of his position.We are crediting the account  she sent with just $2.5million per week,with the excuse that the  government will not allow more than that to go out per week.Which is a  lie to slow down the remittance so that we can get someone to use in  making claims also. What we want you to do now is to supply us your banking details so that  we can credit your account as elijah's partner and you can take 25% of  the total amount credited to your account and give us the rest as our  share. Please consider this proposal quickly and reach me immediately with your  answer,because time is not on our side. I am waiting, Yours Truly Engineer George Egobia.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this  country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign  account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of  transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will  require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin  with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign  account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his  request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the  correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from  to your own designation bank account. I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On  smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the  total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of  expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and  internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have  been adviced to keep "Top Secret" as I am still in service and intend to  retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm  the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for  subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated  and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us  to invest in.

I am Mr. Greg  Thambo  a South African and a senior civil servant  (General  supervisor) with South African Gold and Diamond Mining and Processing   company Krugersdrop, the immediate younger brother to Mr. Oliver Thambo   (African National Congress- ANC) who  died in Johannesburg after a long   illness after  he returned to South Africa in 1990 following many years of  living in exile, including in Tanzania , Sweden. On the 24th April 1994, when apartheid was dismantled, the South  African   Government decided to compensate the families of all the Freedom  Fighters   who lost their lives during the struggle by placing the educated elites  in   high offices in South African Government.( KNOWN AS BLACK EMPOWERMENT   PROGRAMME HERE IN SOUTH AFRICA) among which my family was included. For instance, Nelson Mandela was compensated with being the first president of   the Republic of South Africa; Richard Parkes was appointed the manager  of   Shell and BP South Africa petroleum and refinery (S.A.P.R), Jeff Radebe  was    appointed the Minister of public Enterprises and Trevor Manual was   appointed  the Finance Minister. In fact, I got your contact / credibility from South African  information   exchange assisted by the south African Chamber of Commerce and Industry   where I however read your company profile believing in its reputable   capability as regards my intensive purposes to you. As a matter of fact, I have accumulated sufficiently USD$5 MILLION(Five   Million United States Dollars) by virtue of my position in the office  as a   senior civil servant in the South African Gold and Diamond mining  company   Krugersdrop.  Presently, this fund is absolutely kept in an insurance suspense holding in a private security company in South Africa. The   deposition of this fund was made easier for me with a very strong written   agreement and signatory in a different beneficiary under my control. Being a South Africa serving civil servant, it is very difficult for me to   invest this fund here in my country�s the law strictly prohibits. If  the  government got knowledge of it, the fund will be confiscated. I have no   doubt that you understand this point very well. This fund is my  struggle  and  sweat through commissions from unaccountable contracts and other   profitable  additions from the company�s original cost price mostly gained  from  customers around the world. Therefore, my plan and intention about this fund is to transfer it overseas  into a straightforward, trustworthy and God-fearing person�s less taxable   account for investment purpose only. Using your name/company as the   beneficiary of the fund to avoid my government�s intervention. Last  time, I got in contact with some one from South Korea but he became  unnecessarily   greedy concerning his commission in the deal before I decided to  contact   you. If you are interested in assisting me, please notify me immediately on  the  above private telephone number or send me e-mail on my very  confidential   e-mail address. But if you are not in position to assist me, please   maintain  the high level of confidentiality needed in this Transaction. Yours Faithfully.

I am contacting you with the hope that you will be of great assistance to me, I currently have within my reach the sum of 24 million U.S dollars cash which I intend to use for investment purposes outside Nigeria.  This money came as a result of a payback contract deal between my husband and a Russian firm in our country\'s multi-billion dollar Ajaokuta steel plant. The Russian partners returned my husbands share being the above sum after his death. Presently, the new civilian Government has intensified their probe into my husbands financial resources which has led to the freezing of all our accounts, local and foreign, the revoking of all our business licences and the arrest of my First son. In view of this I acted very fast to withdraw this money from one of our finance houses before it was closed down. I have deposited the money in a security company with the help of very loyal officials of my late husband. No record is known about this fund by the government because there is no  documentation showing that we received such funds. The consignment was kept on an "OPEN BENEFICIARY MANDATE" with the Security Company to avoid detection, seizure or diversion. Due to the current situation in the country and government attitude to my family, I cannot make use of this money within, thus I seek your help in transferring this funds out of the sub-African region. Bearing in mind that you may assist me, l have decided to part with 20% of the total sum.

I am (bala tomson Esq),the Head of file Department in  African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist  search.  When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability  and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God  or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15  million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account  that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire  family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got  information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to  come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody  applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in  our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed  next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving  nobody behind for the claim.   It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my  department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release  the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety  and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don’t  want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.  The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank  treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in  this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner,  and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that  30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the  provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses  incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman  colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement  according to the percentages indicated.  Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as  arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of  the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your  private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and  location where the money will be remitted.  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of  the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this  transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of  fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer.  You should contact me on my number (00226-7885 75 97) immediately as soon  as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.  Your’s  faithfully,  BALA TOMSON (Esq.)

Attention Please, I am Dr Hassan Dantata, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting  section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West  Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a  business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end  of the transaction . During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came  across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a  plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank  without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or  relation before our discovery to this development. The said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United  States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive  information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement  to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get  the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been  put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as  soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also  benefit your self to this great business opportunity. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this  country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign  account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of  transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will  require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin  with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign  account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his  request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the  correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from  to your own designation bank account. I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On  smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the  total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of  expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and  internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have  been adviced to keep "Top Secret" as I am still in service and intend to  retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm  the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for  subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated  and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us  to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when  I hear from you.

E-MAIL ;  mm_m_17johnson@yahoo.com.au  DEAR SIR,  Compliments of the day,I understand quite well that this message will sound so strange to you but it is a very serious matter that we need to tackle together very urgent. Before i proceed further,Let me formally introduce myself to you .I am MR. JOHNSON MUGABE, 30 years of age, the first adopted son of president Robert Mugabe, the current Zimbabwean President. I am contacting you today for an urgent assistance to transfer into your account the sum of US$ 19.8 ( NINTEEN POINT EIGHT MILION STATES DOLLARS).  I hope that you may be aware of the recent differences that is going on rigth now between my father and the opposition party in my country, this also brought about the commonwealth community sanctioning my father and freezing all his foreign account both in America and britain.This decision was carried out during the 4 days Commonwealth meeting that was held in Malawi in a part of South East Africa recently.  It will interest you to hear that i never supported my fathers treatment to the white zimbabwean citizens, and this has seriously brought about some personal misunderstanding between me and my father.I have been opposing him since the past five (7) years. Fight so hard to see that he leaves the presidential seat after governing for past 32 years On this account i disassociated myself from him and we do not have any thing in common right now.He even forced me to leave the country with immediate effect after receiving the sanction from the common wealth community, Although he thought that i am behind his delimma. In the year 2004 when i was in good term with my father, he gave me a treasure box containing the sum of US$19.8 milion to deposite in a private security company in Thailand for safe keeping, So i did exactly as he instructed me without disclosing the actual content of the box to the security company,every documents was signed and documented in   my names and details.This money has been lying in the security company for the past 8 months.  Now that he sent me out on exile, i left zimbabwe to Thailand where i am currently seeking political assylum.My aim of travelling to Thailand was to claim the money and transfer it out of Thailand to any other country that will be safe for investment. I am contacting you therefore on the account that you will support me to secure the fund in good condition and also come over to Thailand so that we can both claim the fund together, and then we travel down to your country for proper investment of the fund.  I have visited the security company and made every neccessary enquiry concerning the fund and it is still intact in the security house.I will compensate you with 7%of the total sum (i.e US$ 1,386 000.00) and i have set aside another 8% (i.e US$1,584 000.00) for any expenses that may be incured during the transaction. Please this is a very confidential matter that needs utmost secrecy and confidentiality, so i am really pleading to you to try as much as possible to keep every aspect of this confidential. Please also do not reveal it to any one as my hope and futture solely depend on this money and if you are willing to work with me and assist me on this transaction,then do not hesitate to contact me immediately by sending me your TELEPHONE and FAX NUMBERS,and reply me through my e-mail address for us to carry on with the next step of the transaction.

Director, WELLKANG INTERNATIONAL,  IMPORT/EXPORT. ___________________________________________________________________________', "URGENT MAIL URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL  Goodday  Sir/Madam I am a member of Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP), Switzerland. ICEP is charged with the responsibility of finding bank  accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss indigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II.  It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's  Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by non-Swiss citizens.  These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May 9, 1945).  Most belonged to Holocaust victims. The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP) have since resulted in  the discovery of additional dormant accounts - 54,000 in December,  1999.  The published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including interest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe  deposit boxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. Numbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on  accounts that were interest bearing when established. The Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims on accounts  due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE with a credit balance of 20,000,000 US dollar plus accumulated interest was  discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs.  The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit  balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by the law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died  interstate (living no wills).  Being a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary contacts for claim of the funds  without any hitch.we can share the funds and use in investment of our  choice.  Due to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim the funds. All that is required is for you to provide me  with your details for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim documents for transfer of the funds to you.  Kindly provide me with your full name, address,date of birth and telephone/fax. We will pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is  transferred to a secure, numbered account in your name in Spain, of which you will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and  transferring to your country and other banks of choice in the world. My share will be 60 percent and your share is 40 per cent of the total  amount.  You can find additional information about unclaimed funds through the internet at the following websites:  www.swissbankclaims.com  http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9902/09/germany.holocaust/  www.avotaynu.com  www.icheic.org  www.livingheirs.com  www.wiesenthal.com  I find myself priviledged to have this information and this may be a great opportunity for a life time of success without risks.

Based on these developments, his various foreign bank accounts have been frozen and some are still under serious investigation. But in the light of all these happenings, President Charles Taylor was able, through the help of some loyalist succeeded to secretly move the sum of US$78M, on my name as the owner to a private security company vault in  Nigeria where the final crediting is expected to be carried out later, but resently he has just been arrested and taken away. you can read more on CNN news of March 30, 2006. http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/africa/03/29/taylor.nigeria/index.html  All the depositing documents of the above fund were on my name and they are still in my possession, What I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum and I will arrange for the documentation which will enable the Security Company transfer / wire the fund to your bank account. I have decided to do this only with you and use this sum to relocate to European or American continent and never to be connected to any of President Charles Taylor's conglomerates. This transaction can be concluded within 2 weeks.  My questions are:-   1. Can you handle this project?   2. Can I give you this trust?   3. can you keep this business as very confidential?   4.

I hope that you may be aware of the recent differences that is going on rigth now between my father and the opposition party in my country, this also brought about the commonwealth community sanctioning my father and freezing all his foreign account both in America and britain.This decision was carried out during the 4 days Commonwealth meeting that was held in Malawi in a part of South East Africa recently.  It will interest you to hear that i never supported my fathers treatment to the white zimbabwean citizens, and this has seriously brought about some personal misunderstanding between me and my father.I have been opposing him since the past five (7) years. Fight so hard to see that he leaves the presidential seat after governing for past 32 years On this account i disassociated myself from him and we do not have any thing in common right now.He even forced me to leave the country with immediate effect after receiving the sanction from the common wealth community, Although he thought that i am behind his delimma. In the year 2004 when i was in good term with my father, he gave me a treasure box containing the sum of US$19.8 milion to deposite in a private security company in Thailand for safe keeping, So i did exactly as he instructed me without disclosing the actual content of the box to the security company,every documents was signed and documented in my names and details.This money has been lying in the security company for the past 8 months.  Now that he sent me out on exile, i left zimbabwe to Thailand where i am currently seeking political assylum.My aim of travelling to Thailand was to claim the money and transfer it out of Thailand to any other country that will be safe for investment. I am contacting you therefore on the account that you will support me to secure the fund in good condition and also come over to Thailand so that we can both claim the fund together, and then we travel down to your country for proper investment of the fund.  I have visited the security company and made every neccessary enquiry concerning the fund and it is still intact in the security house.I will compensate you with 7%of the total sum (i.e US$ 1,386 000.00) and i have set aside another 8% (i.e US$1,584 000.00) for any expenses that may be incured during the transaction.

FROM THE DESK OF : MR MOHAMAT ALI, AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING SECTION, AFRICAN DEVLOPMENT BANK ( A.D.B ) OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO,WEST AFRICA. Attention Please, I am Mr Mohamat Ali, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting  section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West  Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a  business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end  of the transaction . During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came  across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a  plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank  without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or  relation before our discovery to this development. The said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United  States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive  information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement  to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get  the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been  put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as  soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also  benefit your self to this great business opportunity. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this  country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign  account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of  transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will  require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin  with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign  account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his  request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the  correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from  to your own designation bank account. I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On  smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the  total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of  expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and  internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have  been adviced to keep "Top Secret" as I am still in service and intend to  retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm  the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for  subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated  and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us  to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when  I hear from you. I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication, Yours faithfully, Mr Mohamat Ali.

From my  investigation, I found out that this account belongs to one Late Mr.  HAJI  EL JAMAL ZOUE, a citizen of Lebanon who died on the recent plane crash in  Cotonou Benin republic on the 26th of Dec. 2003 You can seach the Webside. site;http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/index.html ) I have kept a close monitoring of the account since then and nobody has come  forward to claim the money as next of kin to the Late Mr  HAJI EL JAMAL  ZOUE, meaning that no one is aware of the account. I cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and  that is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and  share it with me.

Email:da_sarr@katamail.com  Tel:  +221-4488469   Dear friend,   I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as i am using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek for foreign assistance in a business.   I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail.   I am contacting you concerning a customer and deposit placed under our banks management 10 years ago,i am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication.   I am Mr.David Saar from Ecobank,Dakar-Senegal.Branch.This business request may seem strange, but I crave your indulgence and pray you view it seriously as I am convinced that you would be capable to provide me with a solution to a money transfer.   On 6th,june,1997, a Nigerian came to make a (fixed) deposit valued at US$10,500,000.00(Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars )in  my branch to be claimed by a foreing beneficiary to be later named,upon maturity,we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.   After three years of sending reminder with no responce,we decided to open an investigation,and i was the head of the panel set up for the investigation,in the course of our investigation i finally discovered the money was Part of the loot the late Nigerian Ruler General Sani Abacha stole from Nigeria,the money was deposited under a false name. you can  confirm it yourself via the website below.  http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/columnists/wickham/2002-04-19-wickham.htm.   On further investigation, I found out that no one knows of the deposit not even his family members he died without telling any one of it.Therefore he did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank as the deposit was a secret one,so i decided to keep the secret to my self as i view this as a once in a lifetime oportunity for me.   My bank has waited for the beneficiary to come and make claims but no one has ever come forward,the reason is that he was yet to name the beneficiary before he died and i am the only one aware of this fact because i am the one in charge of the transaction.   This sum of US$10,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the  principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it According to my Country's law, at the expiration of 10(TEN)years,the money will revert to the ownership of the SENEGALESE Government if nobody  applies to claim the fund.   Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to  stand as the beneficiary to the deposit so that the money will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you in a few days.   I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deposit.This is simple,upon your approval,I will like you to  provide immediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the beneficiary.   We shall employ the service of two attorneys for the drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter  of probate administration in your favour for the transfer.   Any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will  then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary.   The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 35% for me,35% for you,20% for any charity organization of our choice and 10 % will be set aside for expenses  incured during the business .   There is no risk at all;i have waited eigth(8)years now to be very sure of this plan,the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below, upon your response, I shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.   Please observe outmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.   Please upon your approval of this mail message, send to me the following  to enable me start the processing of the fund transfer into your bank account:  1.) The beneficiary's name and complete info.2.) Your private / official telephone and fax number.   I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive or destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole banking sector.   I do not find this move against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones way once in a lifetime. I cannot afford to let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in total control of my destiny. This is my chance and I won't let it pass me by.If you will not work with me let me know  and let me move on with my life but please do not destroy me.I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide my family with new opportunities.   There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking.I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank.

Since we got information about his death, we have been  expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot  release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that  all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the  plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make  this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of  kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since  nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidline here  stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the  bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreign as next of kin in  this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner  and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in  respect to the provision of a foreign account, 5% will be set aside for  expenses incured during the business and 65% would be for me and my  colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for  disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged,  you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased  indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone  and fax number for easy and effective communication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail the text of  the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this  transaction is risk-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear  as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter for  more explanations.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this  country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign  account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of  transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will  require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin  with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign  account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his  request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the  correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from  to your own designation bank account. I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On  smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the  total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of  expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and  internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues.

Best Regard's  Mr.Peter Herry ", 'REPLY Dear friend,   I am contacting you from London. My name is Jim Owens. A Top Management Official of one of the finance Corporation in London.Please do not get upset as to how I got your contact. I got your email Contact from the Internet.  I sincerely advise that you calm down to read below propos thoroughly and thereafter decide if we can do the business together. It is no setup or one of these hoaxes from Africa. This is a real deal and I mean every word I speak here.   A US citizen, Mr. Norman Anderson has been a customer of my bank since 1988. He opens a domiciliary account with us in June 1988. The said bank account, which is at the moment in dormant, is in UK pounds sterling and has credit balance of 29.3M pounds. Last transaction carried on the account dates back to September 15,1999.   I have been the account ownerâ€™s confidant and account officer until above date when he was last seen in the bank. And since this time Mr. Anderson has not been to the bank nor sent in cheque for clearing. This became a source of worry to me and prompted my personal investigation as to where about and business activity of this customer.  Result of my investigation revealed that he was into oil bunkering and operated within West and Central Africa sub-regions. Further investigation proved that he was one of the victims of November 1999 raid of illegal oil bunkering merchants in Malabo Island of Equatorial Guinea.   However, I continued my investigation and further discovered that a UK telephone number mentioned in our bank information form, which he filled when the said bank account was established, belong to hotel in London. This is a clear indication that he probably has fed my bank with false information to protect his illegal oil deals.   I have not disclosed these findings to anyone else except this message to you. After a careful study of the account file and available data to me, I have packaged a good deal as follows; and will wish to carry it out with you. My Dear Friend, the deal here is that the money in this account will be approved and remitted to any foreigner who shows up as relation to Mr. Anderson provided such person has correct information to the account. I have such needed information and will hand it over to you as soon as we commence the transaction.      I will source all necessary documents and forward them to you for   Direct submission to  the bank. With my position as the foreign operations manager we will quietly remove this money from the bank without hitches. I donâ€™t have any problem in regularizing all necessary   documents and transferring the credit balance of the said account to your nominated bank account in overseas, but the problem is trust. I have spent months in trying to get an overseas reliable contact. It is worthy to note that people are unreliable these days and even derive joy in telling lies. On this ground I request youâ€™re unreserved but sincere cooperation devoid of greed in carrying out this transaction so that no one amongst both of us shall defraud each other at the end. I am prepared to split at 60%---40% for you, provided that mine (60%) will be intact at the end.  Waits for  your expected co-operation. Reply and send your Address, tel and fax number.

Email:da_sarr@katamail.com Tel:  +221-4488469  Dear friend,  I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as i am using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek for foreign assistance in a business.  I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail.  I am contacting you concerning a customer and deposit placed under our banks management 10 years ago,i am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication.  I am Mr.David Saar from Ecobank,Dakar-Senegal.Branch.This business request may seem strange, but I crave your indulgence and pray you view it seriously as I am convinced that you would be capable to provide me with a solution to a money transfer.  On 6th,june,1997, a Nigerian came to make a (fixed) deposit valued at US$10,500,000.00(Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars )in  my branch to be claimed by a foreing beneficiary to be later named,upon maturity,we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After three years of sending reminder with no responce,we decided to open an investigation,and i was the head of the panel set up for the investigation,in the course of our investigation i finally discovered the money was Part of the loot the late Nigerian Ruler General Sani Abacha stole from Nigeria,the money was deposited under a false name. you can  confirm it yourself via the website below.  http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/columnists/wickham/2002-04-19-wickham.htm.  On further investigation, I found out that no one knows of the deposit not even his family members he died without telling any one of it.Therefore he did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank as the deposit was a secret one,so i decided to keep the secret to my self as i view this as a once in a lifetime oportunity for me.  My bank has waited for the beneficiary to come and make claims but no one has ever come forward,the reason is that he was yet to name the beneficiary before he died and i am the only one aware of this fact because i am the one in charge of the transaction.   This sum of US$10,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the  principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it According to my Country's law, at the expiration of 10(TEN)years,the money will revert to the ownership of the SENEGALESE Government if nobody  applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to  stand as the beneficiary to the deposit so that the money will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you in a few days.   I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deposit.This is simple,upon your approval,I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the beneficiary.  We shall employ the service of two attorneys for the drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter  of probate administration in your favour for the transfer.  Any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will  then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 35% for me,35% for you,20% for any charity organization of our choice and 10 % will be set aside for expenses  incured during the business .   There is no risk at all;i have waited eigth(8)years now to be very sure of this plan,the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

J'ai une nouvelle adresse mail Vous pouvez maintenant m'écrire à : joemick122@yahoo.fr Dear Sir/Ma Naturally, this letter will come to you as a surprise, since we have not met, permit me however, I am Barrister Jonathan Micheal, I am contacting you to kindly assist me in the Project below, which will be of mutual benefit to us both. A salvadorean, Mr. Ramirez Cathy, 66 years of age and a very prosperous farmer made a huge bank deposit for investment in the sum of US$17.5 Million (Seventeen Million, Five hundred Thousand United States Dollars)he named his wife Mrs. Helga Cathy as the NEXT OF KIN . I was called upon as an Accredited Attorney to the bank to sign and endorse documents to thisdeposit on Mr.Cathy's behalf. Unfortunately, Mr. & Mrs.Cathy were killed in theJanuary 14, earthquake that rocked El Salvador, killing thousands ofpeople and 1,200 others were declared missing. The bank management now mandates me (being the lawyer that signed and endorsed the deposit papers for the deceased to trace the family relatives of the deceased so that the fund will be released to them.I was made to understand that they had no children. I made several efforts through the El Salvador High Commission in Lagos to contact any of the deceased family relatives, but to no avail. Failure to reach any of the family relatives of the deceased,the only option left for the Bank's Management is to declare the deceased account dormant and revert the fund on trading and investment in the interestof the bank. In order to avoid this development since it has so far been impossible to trace any of the deceased familyrelatives. I now seek your permission and assistance to have you stand as a distant relatives to the deceased. So that the fund can be released to you and we can use it for ourmutual benefit. I hope you do understand my concern in this matter, if we do not use this opportunity to claim this fund,since the deceased relatives cannot be traced, the management of the bank will declare the deceased's account dormant and revert the fund on Trading and Investment in the interest of the bank.

But  all the same, I believe we do not  need to be of blood relatives before we can establish cordial/business  relationship. Having said this,I  think it is very important at this juncture to introduce myself to you.  I am Mr.Wiilams Terry  , Head: Enterprise Wide Risk and member of the  executive and risk committees of  Commecial Bant of Senegal.I got your information while browsing  through internet in search of a  reliable person who will assist me.This is an urgent and very  confidential business proposition.  On June 7, 2000,a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the  Senegal Institute of Mining and  Metallurgy, Mr.Kurt Kahle made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for  twelve calendar months, valued at  US$10,500, 000.00,(Ten Million, five hundred thousand Dollars).  Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address  but got no reply. After a month, we  sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his Private Business  School. employers, that On the 31st  of July 2000, our client, with his 37-year-old wife and his son  Michael, aged eight died in the Air France  concord plane crash bound for New York in their plan for a world  cruise, with other passengers abroad  as you can confirm it yourself via the website below:  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm  On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a  "WILL",and all attempts to trace his  next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and  discovered that Mr.Mr.Kurt Kahle did  not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official  documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork  in my Bank. This sum of US$10,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my  bank for safekeeping. No one  will ever come forward to claim it.According to Senegal Law, at  the expiration of 5 (five) years, the  money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies  to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to  stand as the next of kin to Mr. Kurt Kahle  so that the fruit of this old man\'s labor will not get into the hands  of some corrupt Government officials.I  am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign  account. I want to present you  as the owner of the funds so you will be able to claim them with the  help of my attorney.I will like you to  provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney  will prepare the necessary  documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds.  The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me  and 40% for you.

My husband was a great white farmer in Zimbabwe who was brutally murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe by the agents of the ruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for his alleged support and sympathy forthe opposition MDC PARTY led by the minority white farmers.

Recently, my Doctor told me that I might not last for the next Eight months due to an inflammation of my liver. This has led to my being on 24 hours intensive care,in a private clinic here in Cotonou Rep. of Benin. I am tired of living like this. I have decided to donate part of this fund to an individual, group or a charity organisation that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein while half of the money shall be kept for the betterment of my children. I want an individual, or a Charity Organisation that will use this fund for orphanages, widows, and helping land mine victims worldwide.

I am Mr Mark  Hernandez the linkman between the Organization For Petroleum Exporting  Countries - OPEC and World Bank. I also attend OPEC meetings  constantly  in Geneva Switzerland on the auspices of World Bank. Through the sale  of our allocated oil quota in OPEC, I was able to  makeS$22.2million,  which is currently deposited in a Security firm  abroad. I want you to  assist me to claim this money as I cannot claim  it directly because i  am still a Civil servant in active service, and  the code of conduct  bureau forbids me to acquire such huge amount of  money. It is on this  basis that I am contacting you for assistance,  If You will be  interested, and all claim documents will be processed,  and sent to you.  The documents with which the fund is deposited will  be changed to  reflect you as the new beneficiary so that you will be  eligible to  collect the fund on my behalf. I will give you 30% of the  fund for  this assistance, while 60% will be for me and 10% will be for  expenses  that may be incurred on both sides. I am aware of the  international  monitoring of all large-scale financial movements after  the September  11th 2001 Terrorist attack on America (USA) and to avoid  any state of  financial Investigation I will provide a classified  clearance paper  from the relevant body, which will exonerate the money  from drug, money  laundered or terrorist related funds. Kindly respond  to my proposal  through this my private email on the receipt of your  mail indicating  interest. I want to assure you that this is 100% risk  free. I will give  you more details concerning this as soon as I  received your swift  response which must include your full names,  address, occupation, age  phone and fax number.  Expecting your  response.  Yours sincerely, Mr Mark Hernandez.', 'Mr. Paul Moore. Hello friend,   I am contacting you from Africa. My name is Mr. Paul Moore. I work with the Evans National Bank , 14 North Main Street,Angola, NY 14006, as foreign operations manager.  Please do not get upset as to how I got your contact.I got your email contact from the Internet. I sincerely advise that you calm down to read below proposal thoroughly and thereafter decide if we can do the business together. It is no setup or one of these hoaxes from Africa. This is a real deal and I mean every word I speak here.   A UK citizen, Mr. Norman Anderson (from Aberdeen) has been a customer of my bank since 1988. He opened a domiciliary account with us in June 1988. The said bank account, which is at the moment in dormant, is in UK pounds sterling and has credit balance of 19.3M  pounds. Last transaction carried on the account dates back to September 15, 1999. I have been the account owner’s confidant and account officer until above date when he was last seen in the bank. And since this time Mr. Anderson has not been to the bank nor sent in cheque for clearing. This became a source of worry to me and prompted my personal investigation as to whereabouts and business activity of this customer. Result of my investigation revealed that he was into oil bunkering and operated within West and Central Africa sub-regions. Further investigation proved that he was one of the victims of November 1999 raid of illegal oil bunkering merchants in Malabo Island of Equatorial Guinea. However, I continued my investigation and further discovered that a UK telephone number mentioned in our bank information form, which he filled when the said bank account was established, belong to a hotel in London. This is a clear indication that he probably has fed my bank with false information to protect his illegal oil deals. I have not disclosed these findings to anyone else except this message to you. After a careful study of the account file and available data to me, I have packaged a good deal as follows; and will wish to carry it out with you.   My Dear Friend, the deal here is that the money in this account will be approved and remitted to any foreigner who shows up as relation to Mr Anderson provided such person has correct information to the account. I have such needed information and will hand it over to you as soon as we commence the transaction.  I will source all necessary documents and forward them to you for direct submission to the bank. With my position as the foreign operations manager we will quietly remove this money from the bank without hitches. I don’t have any problem in regularizing all necessary documents and transferring the credit balance of the said account to your nominated bank account in overseas, but the problem is trust. I have spent months in trying to get an overseas reliable contact. It is worthy to note that people are unreliable these days and even derive joy in telling lies.    On this ground I request your unreserved but sincere cooperation devoid of greed in carrying out this transaction so that no one amongst both of us shall defraud each other at the end. I am prepared to split at 60%---40% for you, provided that mine (60%) will be intact at the end.   Awaits for your expected co-operation.Reply and send your Address, tel and fax nos.  Best regards,  Mr. Paul Moore.  contact;paul_moore1@myway.com  ', 'URGENT REPLY PLEASE. Dear Friend, Attention Please. Sorry to disturb you.

The said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United  States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive  information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement  to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get  the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been  put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as  soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also  benefit your self to this great business opportunity. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this  country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign  account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of  transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will  require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin  with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign  account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his  request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the  correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from  to your own designation bank account. I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On  smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the  total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of  expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and  internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have  been adviced to keep "Top Secret" as I am still in service and intend to  retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm  the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for  subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated  and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us  to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when  I hear from you. I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication, Yours faithfully, Dr Idris Ali. _________________________________________________________________ Windows Live Messenger : venez tester la version bêta !  http://www.ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionId=5d21c51a-b161-4314-9b0e-4911fb2b2e6d', "DEAR BELOVED. DEAR BELOVED,  I am Sussan Adams  PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD. I am the above named person. I am married to Dr. Donald Adams A LIBERIAN but I’m now in Nigerian General HOSPITAL taking treatment for my sickness, who worked with U.S embassy in LIBERIAN for nine years before he died in the year 2000. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.  When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$10.5 Million (Ten Million five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with A Bank Presently, this money is still under the safe keeping of the Reserve FINANCE COMPANY Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next SEVEN months due to my cancer  problems.  Though what disturbs me most is my stroke.Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a Christian or muslim individual That will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church that will use this fund on, orphanages, deaf and domb and poor widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision.  I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I forward your personal information, such as Your full name, Your full address, with Your telephone and fax number to my lawyer so that he will contact you as the legal owner of my fund before the bank will be transferring the fund into your nominated Bank Account in your country.  I will also issue you a letter of a authority that will back you up as the real next of kin and the original- beneficiary of my fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd,you will also promise me that you will not seat on the fund when it gets into your bank account. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life, any delay in your reply will give me room in serching for a church or Christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible.  Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.

I got your profile from our chamber of commerce and it is with business  trust  that I write to request, you partner with us to facilitate the transfer of  this money to your nominated bank account for our mutual benefits.  Note that 20% will go to you for your efforts and your contribution, 10% is  for miscelleneous expenses incurred by both parties, and 70% will be shared  between me and colleagues which will be use for business investment in your  country under your supervision.

Forgive this unusual manner of contacting you, but this particular letter  is of exceptional and very private nature. There is absolutely going to be  a great doubt and distrust in your heart in respect of this email, coupled  with the fact that, so many miscreants have taken possession of the Internet  to facilitate their nefarious deeds, thereby making it extremely difficult  for genuine and legitimate business class persons to get attention and recognition.  There is no way for me to know whether I will be properly understood, but  it is my duty to write and reach out to you.  For I know that you are the only one that can be trusted to handle this project  effectively without making me regret.  Though this approach appears desperate, difficulties encountered in efforts  to establish a business abroad necessitate this search for someone to assist  me in securing and investing this fund.  My name is Bona Ken, I am the operational manager in account management section  in charge of credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in South  Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank who perished  with his whole families on 18TH JULY 2003 in KENYAN PLANE CRASH with the  whole passengers aboard.  There is an account opened in this bank in 2000 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST  who died without a written or oral 'WILL' attached to the account. Since  his death, I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of  kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and  no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it,the account  has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of his company.  The total amount involved is 116,000,000.00 USD.[One Hundred and Sixteen  Million United States Dollar]. We wish to start the first transfer with $16,000,000.00  [Sixteen Million] and upon successful transaction without any disappointment  from your side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance  to your account.  I have secretly discussed this matter with the general manager of the bank  who I must involve in order to have a smooth and a successful transfer of  the fund to any foreign bank account, which you are going to nominate. On  this note, I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the  foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providing his/her bank  account where the fund will be transferred for immediate investment on any  viable project as no one has come up to be the next of kin.  The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than three  years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury  as unclaimed after this long period of dormancy.  In view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if you  can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a  reliable person who will be capable of receiving such amount in his or her  personal account. At the conclussion of the transfer 60% of the fund will  be for me, I will give you 25% of the total transfer sum, 10% for charity  both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside  to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process.  Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you detailed information about  the transaction. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business  is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not entertain any fear  as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking  days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from the  deceased.  When you receive this letter. Kindly send me e-mail . You should also include  your private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe communication.  Respectfully yours,  Bona Ken.  ______________________________________  Platíte zbyteènì drahé povinné ruèení? Zjistìte si cenu v online kalkulaèce  nebo na tel. 841 444 444.

I am Mr. Cheung Pui director of  operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.I have an obscured business  suggestion for you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client "Major Fadi Basem  who was  with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed  depositfor 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand  United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice  was sent to him,even during the war early this  year. Again after the  war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his  family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their  home. After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi  Basem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including  the paper work of his bankdeposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my  office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So,  Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is  still lying in my bank and no one willever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my  country at the expiration 5 years the funds will revert to the  ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this  backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner  to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem  so that you will be  able to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE: I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we  shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will  prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi  Basem , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to  provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can  commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the  attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the  necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of  the funds to an account that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to  adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the  necessary documents.Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this  issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank  account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for you. Should you be interested please send me your full names and current  residential address and I will prefer you to reach me on the email  address below; EMAIL ADDRESS: cheugpuixx7@yahoo.com.hk  And finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this  operation. Your earliest response to this mail will be appreciated.

Dear Sir, I am MR IAN REED, The Head of Operations Commercial Finance Service. I am writing following an opportunity in my office that will be of immense benefit to both of us. In my Bank we discovered an abandoned sum of US$8 MILLION in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only daughter. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this website. http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/thom02.shtml  http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because the Bank cannot release the funds unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to do business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed bill. We agreed that 20% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, while the balance will be for me and my colleagues. I will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account. Please be honest to me and trust is our Watchword in this transaction. Note this transaction is confidential and risk free. As soon as you receive this mail you should contact me by return mail whether or not you are willing to enter into this deal. In the event you are not interested, I sincerely ask that you disregard this email and tell no one about it. I am very careful on truncating my banking career should you mention this to someone else. I hope you can be trusted in this regard. Please note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to you has been finalized. We will discuss much in details when I do receive your response. In your response, include the following information. {1}Your full name and address {2}Your telephone/Mobile number and fax number {3} Your business name {4} Age and status.

Dear Friend,  I am a director in the foreign affairs department of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). I got your email during a Personal research on the Internet and wish to use this opportunity to notify you of the existence of a certain amount we wish to transfer Overseas for the purpose of investments and importation of goods from your country.  In May 2003, a contract of sixty-six million United States dollars ($66,000,000) was awarded to a foreign company by my ministry. The Contract was supply, erection and system optimization of supper polyore200,000-bpsd, system optimization of 280,000-monax axial plants and the computerization of conveyor belt for Kaduna refinery. With the Consent of only the head of the contract evaluation department, I over Invoiced the contract value by thirty four million  United States dollars ($34,000,000:00).  The contract has since been completed and the foreign company fully paid off. But, in the office files and paper work, the company is still owed USD34M representing the over invoiced amount. Because this amount is derived from the award and execution of a foreign contract, there is no way the money can be paid locally. That is why I am contacting you so that we can do the project together for our mutual benefit. We have concluded every necessary arrangement to transfer this amount to a foreign account as the final phase payment for the said contract.  I solicit your assistance to enable us transfer the said amount into your safe bank account and after we shall come over there to share the money with you. You can either provide us with an existing account or to set up a new bank account immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business trusting in you and believing that you will never let me down either now or in future.  We sincerely need an honest person to work with and have agreed to share the money in the following percentages, 65% will be for us, 30% will be for you whose account is used to secure the funds and 5% will be used to settle every expenses incurred during the transaction like air tickets etc. There is no risk involvement because applications will be made to the concerned Federal ministries and parastatals with official approvals given by the Federal government before the Central bank of Nigeria will be officially authorized to wire the funds to your nominated bank account by telegraphic transfer. Those involved over here are directors in the ministry, they know how best to effect the transfer and will come over there to collect their own share.  If you are interested, contact me via email indicating your full names,company/business name and address. Your direct telephone and fax numbers for effective communication. The name and address of the bank you will like us to deposit the money, the telephone and fax numbers of the bank, the account name and number etc. Everything has been arranged and I will send more information about the business transaction to you as soon as I hear from you. For obvious reasons, please keep the proposal top secret.  Kind regards,  Abraham Patrick', "FROM THE DESK OF MR.AZIZE  OUATTARA FROM THE DESK OF MR.AZIZE  OUATTARA BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK BURKINA FASO. I got your contact address through internet net work search when searching for a good and reliable person that will assist me in this transaction. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 22.85m US Dollars ( twenty two milllion eight hundred and Fifty thousand us dollars)in an account thatbelongs to one of our foreign customer who died on 25th JULY 2000 IN SUPER SONIC CONCORDE plane crash AT CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT IN  PARIS FRANCE along with his entire family. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the  plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this  discovery that I decided to make this business proposal to you and release  the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety  and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and i don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after seven year, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account and 70% would be for ME; Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in  the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail   through my  private line +22676524743 or  email adress  azize_ouattara25@yahoo.com Your's faithfully MR.AZIZE  OUATTARA BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK OUAGADOUGOU,BURKINA FASO _________________________________________________________________ FREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar - get it now!  http://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/", 'URGENT REPLY PLEASE.

The said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United  States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive  information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement  to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get  the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been  put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as  soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also  benefit your self to this great business opportunity. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this  country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign  account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of  transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will  require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin  with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign  account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his  request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the  correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from  to your own designation bank account. I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On  smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the  total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of  expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and  internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have  been adviced to keep "Top Secret" as I am still in service and intend to  retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm  the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for  subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated  and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us  to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when  I hear from you. I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication, Yours faithfully, Dr Idris Ali. _________________________________________________________________ Windows Live Messenger : venez tester la version bêta !  http://www.ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionId=5d21c51a-b161-4314-9b0e-4911fb2b2e6d', "Call for help.

Dear Friend, I am Mr Alexandre Biaise, the Chairman of EUROPEAN UNION CONSTRUCTION  CONTRACT Awarding Committee (EUCCAC) in BURKINA FASO West Africa. I got your information in a business directory from the Burkina Faso Chamber  of Commerce and industries, when I was searching for a reliable, honest and  trust worthy person to entrust this business with. I was  simply inspired and motivated to pick your contact from the  directory. After discussing my view and your profile with my colleagues,  they were very much satisfied and decided to contact you immediately for  this mutual business relationship. We wish to transfer the sum of USD$36.000,000.00 (Thirty Six million United  States Dollars only.) into your personal or company's bank account. This fund was a residue of the over  invoiced contract bills awarded by us  for the supply of equipment,hard/soft wares, pharmaceuticals/medical items  relating to constructing tool's, light and heavy duty vehicles, apparels and  other administrative logistics etc for the Burkina Faso Projects. This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully protected with all the  attendant loop holes sealed off. As the Chairman of CAC, I have the  cooperation and mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary of the  Organization. We arranged and over invoiced the contract funds supplied by different  companies from  different countries. It was our consensus to seek the  assistance of a willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to  transfer this money out of Burkina Faso. This is borne out of our belief in the non-stable and spurious political  nature of this sub-region.The original contractors have been duly paid by  the Bank of Africa Ouaga-Burkina-Faso in West Africa. (Bank of Africa,  Ouaga-Burkina-Faso in West Africa). Through our bankers - Societe Generale Banque. This balance is suspended in  the escrow accounts awaiting claims by any foreign company of our choice. We  intend to pay out this fund NOW as the  organization is winding up its  activities and the coast has been achieved. Based on the laws and ethics of employment, we as civil servants working  under this organization, are not allowed to operate a foreign account. This is the more reason why we needed your assistance to provide an account  that can sustain this fund for safe keeping and our future investment with  your comprehensive advise, assistance and partnership in your country. It is however agreed, as the account owner in this deal to allow you 30% of  the entire sum as compensation, 60% will be held on trust for us while 10% will be used to  defray any incidental charges and cost during the course of the transaction. This transaction will be successfully concluded within 14 days if you accord  us your unalloyed and due cooperation. You should provide the followings; 1, YOUR COMPANY'S NAME WITH COMPLETE ADDRESS, 2, Your TEL AND FAX NUMBERS. (if available) 3, THE NAME OF YOUR BANK, 4, ITS ADDRESS WITH TEL, FAX AND TELEX NUMBERS. 5, ACCOUNT NUMBER. 6, SWIFT CODE. 7, THE COMPLETE MAILING ADDRESS OF THE BENEFICIARY WITH TELEPHONE AND FAX  NUMBERS. Upon the receipt of this information, the documents and approval with the   text will be sent to you for confirmation and then forwarded to the  organization for ratification and subsequent payment. As with the case of all organized (sensitive) and conspired DEALS, we  solicit for your unreserved confidentiality and utmost secret in this  business. We hope to retire peacefully and lead a Honorable business life  afterward. There are no risks involved regards in this business. I suggest you reply me  back for more intimate and details discussions. Yours Faithfully. Mr. MR ALEXANDRE BIAISE. _________________________________________________________________ Don't just search.

BANK  OF AFRICA(B.O.A) OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO Dear Friend, I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department  BANK OF AFRICA . In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of U.S$25M US dollars  (Twenty five Million  US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our  foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2002 in a  plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next if  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that  all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the  plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business  proposal to you so that the money will be released  to you as the next of  kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since  nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank  treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the bank  treasury as unclaimed bill. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this  business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a  Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I  propose  that 30% of this money will be for you as my  foreign partner,  in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10% will be set aside for  expenses incured during the business and 60% would be for me. Thereafter I  will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages  indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged,  you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased  indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your  private telephone  and fax number for easy and effective communication and  location wherein  the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by e-mail a  text of the  application which you'll fill in and send to the bank's email address.. I  will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free  and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required  arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter for  further clearifications. Yours faithfully, .

This is the actual reason why it will  require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin  with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign  account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his  request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the  correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from  to your own designation bank account. I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On  smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the  total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of  expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and  internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have  been adviced to keep "Top Secret" as I am still in service and intend to  retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm  the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for  subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated  and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us  to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when  I hear from you. I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication, Yours faithfully, Dr Idris Ali. _________________________________________________________________ Windows Live Mail : découvrez et testez la version bêta !  http://www.ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionId=5d21c51a-b161-4314-9b0e-4911fb2b2e6d', 'Pls Read From Branch manager,National Bank of Dubai Hello My Dear,  I got your contact through Internet searching and browsing and I want  to establish a business relationship with you.

First, I must solicit your strictest confidence  in this ransaction. This is by virtue of it's nature as being utterly  confidential.

I am the personal account officer to the great late  INDUSTRIALIST who has an account in one of the top banks here in South  Africa. The account was opened in 1998 and he died in 2003 without a  written or oral WILL and since 2003 nobody has operated on this account  again hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out  urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.  The owner of this account  is a foreigner and no other person knows about this account or anything  concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and until his death  he was the manager of the company.My investigation through the National  immigration department proved to me as well that he was  single as at  the time of his entry into the Republic of South Africa. The  amount in  this account is USD$125 Million ( One Hundred & Twenty five Million  United States Dollars ) only.  As a matter of fact, I have decided to  transfer this fund abroad for  investment.  Your assistance as a  foreigner is necessary because the management of the bank  will welcome  any foreigner who has correct information to this account which I  will  give to you immediately, if you are interested to do this business with  me.There is no risk in this business.

We  will start the first transfer with Twenty five million [$25,000.000].  Upon successful transfer without any disappointment  from your side, we  shall re-apply for the  payment of the remaining  balance of $100  Million to your account. I am only  contacting you as a foreigner  because this money can not be approved to a local  person here,  but  can only be pproved to any foreigner  who has the correct information  of the account which I will provide for you.  So you should provide me  with your correct account detail where you will like the fund to be  transferred or you can set up a new account for the transfer  even an  empty account is ok.

My Dear Friend in the Lord,  In a brief, I am Mrs Teressa Stevens, Wife of late Mr Stevens James, a white  farmer, murdered by unknown assailants 2003 in Zimbabwe.  My husband was a great white farmer in Zimbabwe who was brutally murdered in the  land dispute in Zimbabwe by the agents of the ruling government of President  ROBERT MUGABE for his alleged support and sympathy for the opposition MDC PARTY  led by the minority white farmers. My husband was among the few white rich  farmers murdered in cold blood by the war veterans backed by the government.  Before the death of my husband, he deposit the sum of US$20.5M (Twenty Million  Five hundred thousand United State Dollars) with one of the Financial  Institution, as if he knew the looming danger in ZIMBABWE. We were married for  twelve years and God blessed us with twin’s children.  Presently this money is still with the Financial Institution. Recently, my  Doctor told me that I might not last for the next Eight months due to an  inflammation of my liver. This has led to my being on 24 hours intensive care,  in a private clinic here in Cotonou Rep. of Benin. I am tired of living like  this.  I have decided to donate part of this fund to an individual, group or a charity  organisation that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein  while half of the money shall be kept for the betterment of my children. I want  an individual, or Charity Organisation that will use this fund for orphanages,  widows, and helping land mine victims worldwide.  I took this decision because my husband's relatives are Trouble Makers and I  don't want my husband's efforts to be used for trivialities I do not want a  situation where my husband's sweat will be used in material pursuits. This is  why I am taking this decision.  As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact name of my lawyer,  telephone number and email address who will issue you a letter of authority  that will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund.  Please ensure to contact with this email:teressa_stevens@caramail.com to enable  me direct you to my lawyer.

In fact, he said and I quote ?°my beloved son, I wish to draw your attention to the sum of US$17 million. I deposited the said fund in a private account of a Bank in Johannesburg, South Africa; all the documents regarding the fund are with your mother. I was very dedicated and committed to wining the ongoing war against the rebels until when I found out that some senior army officers and government functionaries were busy helping themselves with government funds and properties, sending them to foreign countries. Due to this, when I and former special adviser to the President were assigned by the President (Hassan al-Bashir) to purchase arms in South Africa, we saw this as an opportunity to divert the money for our personal use. When we divided the money, my share was US$17 million. I did this in case of my absence due to death so that you, Abubaka your two sisters and your mother wouldn't suffer. Take my advice my son; and please be serious with your Studies, I will like you to please take care of this money properly for your future and of your mother's and sisters You should solicit for assistance of a reliable and sincere foreign partner to assist you to transfer this money out of South Africa for investment. I deposited the money in your name and you alone with the deposit code, for you to can claim it. Your mother is with all the documents; take good care of your mother and your two sisters. Do not disappoint me! Good-bye. From this word of my late husband, you will understand that the lives and future of my family depend on this fund as such I will be grateful if you can assist us. Now what I want you to do for us is to help us clear this sum from the bank using your name which should be as the foreign partner of my late husband.

Je m\'appelle Dr   Patrice Kone. Dans mon département,il a été découvert une importante somme d\'argent qui  appartenait à un de nos clients qui mourut lors d\'un accident d\'avion en  juillet 2000 avec sa famille entière ne laissant personne pour réclamer  cette fortune qui s\'élève à $15 M USD(américains).Vous pouvez avoir plus  d\'informations de cet accident sur ce site  Web:http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm Depuis lors, personne ne s\'est présenté pour réclamer cette somme qui se  trouve dans notre banque. Or, les règlements bancaires en Afrique stipulent  que, si une telle somme reste sans revendication après une période de  5ans,ceci doit être virée dans dans le compte de trésor bancaire. C\'est afin  d\'éviter que ce fond profite au gouvernement burkinabé que mon collègue et moi avons décidé de chercher un partenaire étranger qui peu nous aider à  faire transférer cette somme dans son compte bancaire. Ceci dit, vous devrez  vous présenter au niveau de la banque comme héritier du défunt afin de  devenir bénéficiaire de ce fond. Le choix d\'un étranger pour jouer ce rôle  révèle du fait qu\'un burkinabé ne peut pas se présenter comme héritier(e) de  notre défunt client Nous acceptons que vous aurez les 30% du partage,mon  collègue et moi aurons les 60% alors que 10% seront consacrés aux dépenses  survenues lors du transfert. Une fois ce fond transféré, mon  collègue et  moi viendrons sur place chez vous en vue du partage, conformément aux  pourcentages sus indiqués. Ainsi vous devez me donner toutes vos  coordonnées, ce qui me permettra de mieux vous connaître et de vous envoyer  le texte d\'application(demande de transfert).Je vous rassure que ce business  est à 100%sans risque et que vous ne devrez mettre en vous aucun atome de  crainte.

On the 25th October 2005 at about 5am my father a prominent businessman  was taken away from us by a group of uniformed men. During our visit to  him in his detention, he told us that he knew about the alleged coup plan  but did not pledged his sponsorship yet until the day of his arrest. All  the detainees were ill treated and are still undergoing such even now. The  President Mr. Teodoro Nguema Obiang has done nothing about it.  On the 20th of October 2005, We was refused of seeing my father. At this  point we had to consult the attention of our family lawyer who intervened  and further revealed that my father has died, the government suppressed  the news and our query about the cause of his death was never answered. At  this point it was not safe for us to keep residing in the country  graciously with the help of our family lawyer most of our family  properties and business were retrieved back from the government. They were  as followings: [milling company, Maswan Royal estate, Guinea printing  press, mechanized farm, franchise and landed properties] my family agreed  on selling them before our departure. A sum of US$9.6 million was  realized.  A high government official who was a good family friend to us arranged an  emergency exit to South Africa where we presently reside as asylum  seekers. The fund was in a diplomatic suitcase. And due to the fact that  as refugees, we are restricted to many facilities in the country of South  Africa like banking and financing. I had to keep the consignment under the  custody of a security company here in South Africa.  My dear, I need an honest person who would help me transfer the fund into  a foreign account, as I am not allowed to operate a bank account as  refugee. After the fund is transferred into your bank account my family  shall come over to where ever  the transfer is done to begin a new life.  I am residing here in South Africa with my mother, Mrs. Stella Maria  Obiang and My name is Charles Obiang.  We have agreed that 30% of the total sum shall be given to anyone who  would help us in this transaction and 5% will be used to settle every  expense that was incurred during the course of the transfer.  The following conditions must be noted:  The person needed:  a. Must not be a minor  b. Legal in the country he/she resides  c. He/ She must have a prove of his / her legality.  NB: All the parties must keep a prove of their expenditures for  reimbursement immediately the fund is transferred. We would like you to do  feasibility studies on how and which area in your country we could invest  our part of fund as soon as we arrive into your country.

I got your contact address through  internet net work search when searching for a good and reliable person that  will assist me in this transaction. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 22.85m US Dollars (  twenty two milllion eight hundred and Fifty thousand us dollars)in an  account thatbelongs to one of our foreign customer who died on 25th JULY  2001 IN SUPER SONIC CONCORDE plane crash AT CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT IN  PARIS FRANCE along with his entire family. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his  supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving  nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I  decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you  as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent  disbursement since nobody is coming for it and i don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclamed after four year, the money will be transfered into the Bank  treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by  the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as  next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in  respect to the provision of a foreign account and 70% would be for ME; Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged,  you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased  indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone  and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of  the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this  transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear  as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

Dear Friend,  I am Rev.Fr. Peter Clark, a senior staff with the UN special duties office ;my office monitors and controls the affairs of all banks and financial institutions. I have before me list of funds, which could not be transferred to some nominated accounts as these accounts have been identified either as ghost accounts, unclaimed deposits or over-invoiced sum etc. I have the opportunity to write you based on the instructions among others i received days ago from the officer in the computer section in person of Engineer Peter Cliff,to bring out part of your total pending payment with reference number (LM-05-371) amounting US$10million. The (Ten Million Dollars) is arranged in a security-proof box weighing 75kg. In order to get the box shipped to you.  A lot of people are interested in your payment and those people are merely doing paper works with you and that explains why you receive different kinds of untrue fax and phone messages from different people everyday. As I found out that you have almost met all the statutory requirements in respect of your pending payment.

A friend of mine who is a diplomat disclosed to me that there is a security courier service company that is specialised in sending diplomatic materials and information from one country to another, with diplomatic immunity and consignment such as this cannot be checked by any customs anywhere in the world unlike Dhl, Ems, FedEx and Ups because, they will have to open the box for inspection by the customs before shipment. This is what we want to avoid because this box is been padded with synthetic nylon and to open it you will have to cut the pad before you will meet the button that you will press to open the dial code-lock. There is no way you can open the box and be able to close it again because it was padded with machine. I have therefore met the official of the security courier service and concluded shipping arrangement with them, which they will commence as soon as I have your go ahead order. The diplomat will bring the consignment to you, he has been!    in this line of work for many years now ;so you have notting to worry about.  I am conditionally prepared to assist you get the money, practically after studying the part leading to this particular stage in the payment process in connivance with your local collaborators to conceal the authentic source of the funds.And my only condition for this unusual assistance is after all arrangements we have concluded that you must donate Five Hundred Thousand United States dollars (US$500,000.00) to any charity organisation I designate as soon as you receive your money. To this effect, you will send to us a promissory note for the donation along with your address where you will like the box to be delivered to by courier. May almighty God bless you, Please maintain topmost secrecy as it may cause a lot of problems if found out that we are using this way to help you. You are advised not inform anyone about this until you received your money. When you conclude this we will help to ship the final part of your money to you.

Further to this, I will like to give you a little more information about me, I am an American but married into the Sharjah Royal Family here in Sharjah United Arab Emirate, but at the moment undergoing a divorce case with my husband through the sharia court and hopefully will get this matter over within a couple of weeks and that is why I want to calve a niche for myself to be able to continue with my life and make my life meaningful when I leave my husband’s family. The funds I intend to invest with you is currently in a UAE bank here as was deposited by my late father who worked before he died as a chemical engineer in the Saudi Oil Corporation ARAMCO and later the Emirate National Oil Corporation ENOC.  My reason of trying to establish my own business is necessitated by the advent of my divorce suite with my husband and according to the sharjah marital law here, if my husband family gets any knowledge of the funds in the bank, they will take possession of the funds since my father used my name as the next of kin.  It is my wish to handle this matter privately under the most cautious legal arrangement to get the funds into your possession before we can commence any trade deal and therefore demand that you kindly give me a brief information about you with pictures, contact address and telephone numbers incase I want to call you .  Pls can you tell me if you can deal with my lawyer who practice in Abu Dhabi – U.A.E as the funds I wish to invest into the business is in a bank there and I will like to get you introduced to my lawyer who is also an American and works with the emirate international law firm. the money in question (US$9,750,000) was deposited into the bank about two years back before my father died of heart failure and ever since his death, my relationship with my husband has gone bad due to the fact that I’ve been married to him for six years now and we have no issue.  My lawyer advised that what we shall do is to portray you as an investor who has given that money to my father before he died for a crude oil lifting from the Saudi oil corporation but the deal was thwarted due the sudden death of my father.  By this strategy, the lawyer will present some letter of administration and application to the bank for the release of the funds to you under the emirate inheritance law. This logistics is to get the funds transferred to you as the bonafide owner of the funds to avoid any implications that will not permit me as being married to the royal family to possess such chattel or estate of my late father in conformity with the sharia marital law.

First, I must solicit  your strictest confidence in this transaction. This is by virtue of  it's nature as being utterly confidential. I am sure and have  confidence of your ability and reliability to prosecute a transaction  of this great magnitude. I solicit your assistance to enable us  transfer the said amount into your safe account for unward investment.

I am the  personal account officer to the great late INDUSTRIALIST who has an  account in one of the top banks here in london. The account was opened  in 1993 and he died in 1993 without a written or oral WILL and since  2003 nobody has operated on this account again hence the money is  floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be  forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is a foreigner and no  other person knows about this account or anything concerning it, the  account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the manager  of the company.My investigation through the National immigration  department proved to me as well that he was single as at the time of  his entry into the Republic of South Africa. The amount in this account  is USD$26 Million (Twenty Six Million United States Dollars ) only.  As a matter of fact, I have decided to transfer this fund abroad for  investment. Your assistance as a foreigner is necessary because the  management of the bank will welcome any foreigner who has correct  information to this account which I will give to you immediately, if  you are interested to do this business with me.There is no risk in this  business. With my position and my personal contact with the manager of  the bank, the money can be transferred to any account you can provide  with assurance that this money will be intact pending my physical  arrival in your country for sharing. We will start the first transfer  with Six million [$6,000.000] to testrun your account. Upon successful  transfer without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply  for the payment of the remaining balance of $26 Million to your  account. I am only  contacting you as a foreigner because this money  can not be approved to a local person here, but can only be pproved to  any foreigner who has the correct nformation of the account which I  will provide for you.  So you should provide me with your correct  account details where you will like the fund to be transferred or you  can set up a new account for the transfer even an empty account is  okay. At the conclussion of the transfer you will take 35%,5% will be  for any expenses both parties incurred in the process of this business  and the remaining 60% will be for me.

This has led to my being on 24 hours intensive care,  in a private clinic here in Cotonou Rep. of Benin. I am tired of living like  this.  I have decided to donate part of this fund to an individual, group or a charity  organisation that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein  while half of the money shall be kept for the betterment of my children. I want  an individual, or Charity Organisation that will use this fund for orphanages,  widows, and helping land mine victims worldwide.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim hismoney because we can not release it unless somebody applies for it asnext of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next ofkin or relation died along side with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that Iand one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don.t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money  remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot standas next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will befor you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague.

ANYANWU SEEKING YOUR HELP. FROM:- MRS HELLEN P. ANYANWU. JOHANNESBURG SOUTH AFRICA. Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you out of a painful heart and situation, which our  president has caused us the farmers. I know   you may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally. I am HELLEN P. ANYANWU the wife of MR. EVANS PETERSON  ANYANWU, who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe.  I got your contact through network online hence decided to write to you.

Before his murder  had taken me to South Africa to deposit the sum of USD$15. Million (Fifteen MILLION   United States Dollars) in one of the private Security Companies, as if he foresaw  the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was deposited in a box as to avoid more demurrage from the Security Company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of a new farm in Swaziland a small country  near Zimbabwe here.  This land problem came when Zimbabwe President MR. ROBERT MUGABE introduced a New Land Act reform, which Wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few Black farmers. This resulted to killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act for which my husband was one of the victims. It is against this background that my family and I who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my husband money to a  foreign Country since the law of South Africa prohibits refugees to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zones of South Africa. As his wife, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking for a  genuine foreign Account where this money could be transferred into without the knowledge of my government who are bent on my family, or I can arrange with the security company to send the money as a consignment to their sister company in your country for you to go there and sign it out. I must also let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free. If  you accept to assist me and my family then the lawyer or consultant will help me and you in opening a non resident account in your name   which will aid us in transferring the money into any account you will nominate overseas or you provide your address were the security company can ship it as a consignment to you.  This money I intend to use for investment and growth in your country. I have two options; firstly you can choose to have certain Percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction, or you can go into partnership with me for proper profitable investment of this money in your country. Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses we might incur in the   process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you 25% of the  total money while remaining 70% will remain for my family and me.

I trained and work as an external auditor for the International Financial Services Ltd for Anglo Irish Bank. Working as part of a bigger team that covers the entire Republic of Ireland region.

All the accounts belonging to a single holder with monies totalling a little above ($17.1 Million United States Dollars) plus interest. Banking regulation/legislation in Ireland demand that I notify the fiscal authorities after a statutory time period of twelve years when dormant accounts of this type are called in by the monetary regulatory bodies. The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing and making the following proposal.  My investigations of the said account reveals that the investor died in 1993—the exact time the account was last operated, I can confirm with certainty that the said investor died interstate and no next–of–kin to his estate has been found or has come forward all these years.  I am of the settled conviction that using my insider leverage, I, working with you can secure the funds in the account for us instead of allowing it pass as an unclaimed funds into the coffers of the Irish Government. This is especially possible as you bear the same LAST NAME to the said investor, and can stand as his extended relative. This exactly is why I crave your participation and co-operation.  I have seized all relevant documents (Legal and Banking) that will facilitate our putting you forward as the claimant/beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated by you. Of course you shall be handsomely rewarded for your part in this transaction as the people I am working with have agreed to allocate a 30% of the total funds for your efforts, less any expenses.  I shall however leave out the finer details of this transaction till I receive an affirmation of your desire to participate.  Be assured that me and my colleagues are on top of the situation. There will be no risk involved whatsoever if you agree to come on board. Needless to say, UTMOST CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if we are to successfully reap the immense benefits of this transaction.  To maintain the level of security required to see this transaction come to a successful conclusion, I have intentionally left out the finer details.

Dear Friend,  I am Mr.Vincent Nicholas, I am an accountant with the HSBC BANK UK.I  am very sorry if this is an inconvinience in any way, just that i  need you to see me through with this transfer. This business request  may seem strange, but I crave your indulgence and pray you view it  seriously as I am convinced that you would be capable to provide me  with a solution to a money transfer.  On June 16, 2000, a German property magnate Mr. Andrea Schranner  made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar  months,valued at £6,500,000.00(Six Million Five Hundred Thousand  Pounds Sterling )in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine  notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from  his contract employers (the Petroleum Corporation) that Mr. Andrea  Schranner died in an air crash with his family.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a  will and attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I  therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Andrea  Schranner did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his  official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork. This sum  of £6,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the  principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward  to claim it .According to British law, at the expiration of 7 years,  the money will revert to the ownership of the Bristish Government if  nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner  to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Andrea Schranner.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full  name and address so that an accredited Attorney working with the  bank here will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which  will put you in place as the next of kin.We shall employ the service  of two attorneys for the drafting and notarization of the will and  obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate administration  in your favour for the transfer into any bank account in any part of  the world which you will provide.We will then facilitate the  transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.The  money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of  50% for me and 30% for you and 10 % will be set aside to ofset any  expenses incured during the business , while the other 10% will go  to charity organisation. There is no risk at all,the paperwork for  this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as an  accountant in the bank with the help of the branch Manager  guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. Please  reply immediately via the private email address below to show your  interest , upon your responses, I shall provide you with more  details and relevant documents that will help you understand the  transaction.  Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that  this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I  shall require your assistance to invest my share of this money in  your country.  Please upon the receipt of this mail message, send to me the  following to enable me start the processing of the fund transfer  into your bank account:  1.) Your full name and address,  2.) Your company name and address if any,.  3.) Your private / official telephone and fax number.

Dear Friend, I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise as we have never met before.My name is Dr.Yacube Akim.I am the bill and exchange manager in African Development Bank.I Hoped that you will not expose or betray this trust and  confident that I am about to repose on you for the mutual benefit of our both families. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of our Bank who perished along with his next of kin with Korean Air Line, flight number 801 with the whole passengers on  6th of augustus 1997 and for your perusal you can view this site http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/guam.passenger.list Since the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of US$8.3M (Eight Million Three Hundred Thoudsand United States Dollars) which has been with our branch for a very  long time. On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the Next of Kin since nobody is coming for the fund again.The Banking ethics here  does not allow such money to stay more than 10 years, because the  money will be recalled to the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund after this period. In view of this I got your contact through the internet when I was making a research on a foreigner that I will use in this great  opportunity because i dont want the money to be recalled to our Bank treasury as  uncliamed fund.I have also agreed to offer 40% of the total sum and the rest 60% will  be for me. The reason for a foreigner in the business is for the fact that the deceased man was a foreigner and  it is not authorized by the law guiding  our Bank for a citizen of this country to make the claim of the fund.So the request of you as a foreigner is necessary to apply for the release and transfer of the fund smoothly into your reliable Bank account as the surving relation to the deceased. If you are really sure of your integerity, trustworthy and confidentiality, and accept not to cheat or disappoint me after this  business, reply with your telephone and fax numbers and banking account details where you wish to receive the fund. Upon receipt of the above mentioned informations,indicating your interest in the business,I will send you by fax or e-mail a letter of  application which you will type  and send back to our bank to enable us start this transaction. I will  not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and dont have any negative impact.You should not entertain any fear as all modalities for the smooth and easy transfer of this fund has been finalized, this  transaction will be completed within 14 bank working days immediately we start the business. Waiting for your urgent response and please kindly delete if you are not interested.

We met in my social club's annual end of the year party and I introduced him to the said security company where he deposit most of his treasures some few weeks later,making me the Legal officer to the account which he operated until his unfortunate demise.On the 31st of March 2001, Engr.Alex, his wife and their two children were involved in a car accident. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives.     After the incident i contacted Engr.Alex sister (Ms Martha Stevens) which was his beneficiary/next of kin but unfortunately before she could claim his estate she too died in September 11, 2001 terrorist attack at the world trade center in the United State Of America. See http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/memorial/lists/by-name/page95.html     Since then I have made several enquiries to locate any of Engr.Alex extended relatives this has also proved unsuccessful.

Recently, my  Doctor told me that I might not last for the next Eight months due to an  inflammation of my liver. This has led to my being on 24 hours intensive care,  in a private clinic here in Cotonou Rep. of Benin. I am tired of living like  this.  I have decided to donate part of this fund to an individual, group or a charity  organisation that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein  while half of the money shall be kept for the betterment of my children. I want  an individual, or Charity Organisation that will use this fund for orphanages,  widows, and helping land mine victims worldwide.

Smith, deputy senior regional manager at Lloyds TSB  Commercial Finance in Yorkshire. I have urgent and very confidential  business proposition for you.  On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit  for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at US$40,000,000.00,  (forty Million, Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address  but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we  discovered from his employers, that Mr. Barry Kelly died from tsunami  on his holidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further  investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all  attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry  Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official  documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum  of US$40,000,000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security  company for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British Law,  at the expiration of (three) years, the money will revert to the  ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the  fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the  owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk  boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the  boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am  writing you because I as a public servant (Manager with the bank), I  cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than  $1m. I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security  company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney.  This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names  and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents  which will put you in place as the as the owner of the boxes. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me  and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this  transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the  successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address  upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and  relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall  require your assistance to invest my share in (Buying of properties  like houses, hotels and doing charity works etc) Please do send me your private/mobile telephone fax number so that we  can have a smooth communication.

Attention Please, I am Georg Path, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section  of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa.  With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business  transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the  transaction . During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came  across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a  plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank  without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or  relation before our discovery to this development. The said amount was U.S 18.4M (Eighteen Million,Four Hundred Thousand United  States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive  information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement  to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get  the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been  put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as  soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also  benefit your self to this great business opportunity. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this  country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign  account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of  transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will  require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin  with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign  account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his  request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the  correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from  to your own designation bank account.

Dear friend , I am the manager of bill and exchange at FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.BANK OF  AFRICA(BOA)I am writing, following the impressive information about you  through one of my friends who runs a consultancy firm in your country. He  assured me of your capability and releability to champion this business opportunity. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of U.S$10m US dollars (Ten  Million US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign  customer who died along with his entire family on Monday,31 July, 2000,in a  plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been  expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot  release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that  all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the  plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make  this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of  kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since  nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidline here  stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the  bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreign as next of kin in  this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner  and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in  respect to the provision of a foreign account, 5% will be set aside for  expenses incured during the business and 65% would be for me and my  colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for  disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged,  you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased  indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone  and fax number for easy and effective communication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail the text of  the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this  transaction is risk-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear  as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter for  more explanations.

Hello,  My name is Mrs. Maureen Foley. I trained and work as an external auditor for the International Financial Services Ltd for Anglo Irish Bank. Working as part of a bigger team that covers the entire Republic of Ireland region. I have taken pains to find your contact through personal endeavours.  On routine audit check last month, I discovered some investment accounts that has been dormant for the last twelve(12) years. All the accounts belonging to a single holder with monies totalling a little above ($17.1 Million United States Dollars) plus interest. Banking regulation/legislation in Ireland demand that I notify the fiscal authorities after a statutory time period of twelve years when dormant accounts of this type are called in by the monetary regulatory bodies. The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing and making the following proposal.  My investigations of the said account reveals that the investor died in 1993—the exact time the account was last operated, I can confirm with certainty that the said investor died interstate and no next–of–kin to his estate has been found or has come forward all these years.  I am of the settled conviction that using my insider leverage, I, working with you can secure the funds in the account for us instead of allowing it pass as an unclaimed funds into the coffers of the Irish Government. This is especially possible as you bear the same LAST NAME to the said investor, and can stand as his extended relative. This exactly is why I crave your participation and co-operation.  I have seized all relevant documents (Legal and Banking) that will facilitate our putting you forward as the claimant/beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated by you. Of course you shall be handsomely rewarded for your part in this transaction as the people I am working with have agreed to allocate a 30% of the total funds for your efforts, less any expenses.  I shall however leave out the finer details of this transaction till I receive an affirmation of your desire to participate.  Be assured that me and my colleagues are on top of the situation.  There will be no risk involved whatsoever if you agree to come on board. Needless to say, UTMOST CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if we are to successfully reap the immense benefits of this transaction.  To maintain the level of security required to see this transaction come to a successful conclusion, I have intentionally left out the finer details.

In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relati on to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don’t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.

I will first introduce myself as Mr.   Barry Henry, a staff in the Private Clients Section of a well-known   bank, here in London, England.  One of our accounts, with holding   balance of £15,000,000 (Fifteen Million Pounds Sterling) has been   dormant and last operated three years ago. From my investigations and   confirmation, the owner of the said account, a foreigner by name John   Shumejda died on the 4th of January 2002 in a plane crash in   Birmingham; you can view this CNN website  http://edition.cnn.  com/2002/WORLD/europe/01/04/england.plane/  for details on the crash.  Since then, nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this   money, as he has no family member that has any knowledge as to the   existence of either the account or the funds; and also Information from   the National Immigration also states that he was single on entry into   the UK.  I have confidently discussed this issue with some of the bank   officials and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal   with. We therefore propose to do business with you, standing in as the   next of kin of these funds from the deceased and funds released to you   after necessary processes have been followed.  This transaction is   totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is legitimate and does   not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal   act.

Yours Faithfully, MR.CHRIS BARTHOLET.", 'Urgent FROM THE DESK OF:  Zhang He,  Bank of China..  Shenzhen China. Dear Kathleen Crain,  I am Zhang He, Bank Manager of the Bank of China, Shenzhen branch, China. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.  On June 7, 2000, a consultant/ contractor with the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation, made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at Twenty One Million Dollars (US$21,000,000.00) only in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to the forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Korea Solid Minerals Corporation that he died along with his wife from a plane crash. On further investigation, I found out that he died Without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that he did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$21,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to Laws of China, at the expiration of eight (8) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Korea Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to assist me in receiving this money as I have every machinery set to enable you receiver this money via a Finance firm based overseas.  I need your urgent assistance so that this money will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will require you to send me your complete names, contact address and telephone and fax numbers so that I will be able to apply for the necessary documents to enable you receive the money via the Finance firm overseas in your name. After receiving the money, we will share in the ratio of 75% for me and 25% for you. Note that the project will be 100% risk free. Considering my position as the credit officer of the bank, I guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. I have the facilities to obtain relevant documents to enable me lift the money from the bank overseas.  If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon your response, I will then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.  I will also let you have the contact details of the Finance Firm and the country it is located in Overseas. Please send me your confidential TELEPHONE and FAX Numbers for fast communication, as I will need to speak to you to personally. You should observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us. Awaiting your urgent reply.  Thanks and regards.  Zhang He.', "MR.

Dear Friend, I am MR SUDIQ BAWA, The Bill and Exchange Manager at the Foreign Remittance  Department of Bank Of AFRICA  (BOA).  I  have an urgent and very  confidential business proposition for you. On october 6, 2002, an American Geologist/Contractor with  the Economic  Community Of West African States (ECOWAS), Dr. George W.Brumley From  Atlanta,U.S.A Deposited the sum of US$15,500,000.00 (Fiften million Five  hundred thousand Dollars only) in my bank. Upon maturity,I sent aroutine   notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we   sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the  Economic Community Of West Africa States (ECOWAS) that Dr George W.Brumley  died in a plane crash with his intire family in Kenya,East Africa in the  year 2003. I want you to visit the website below for more information about the Plane  Crash: http://www.wral.com/news/2345844/detail.html http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/20/kenya.crash/index.html I therefore made further investigation and discovered that In the bank form  for next of kin, George W.Brumley Before his death filled his wife JEAN  BRUMLEY as his next of kin but unfortunately, the wife died with him along  others and therefore, there is nobody left behind to claim the fund of Dr. George Brumley as his next of kin that was why I contacted you and  proposed it as a deal between us. Meanwhile, Official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my  Bank as the next of kin was in the name of his wife. Based on that, No one  will ever come forward to claim it.According to the Burkina Faso Law,under  Burkina's foreign and defense affairs,at the expirationof 3 (Three)  years,such funds will revert to the ownership of the Burkina Faso Government  for financing military operations,such as purchasing of arms and ammunitions  for the military. In order to avert this negative development, I will like to seek for your  permission as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Dr.George W.Brumley  so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not be use for financing  weapons which will further enhance the courses of war in the world in  general. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 55%  for me and 40% for you and 5% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the  transaction.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork  for this  transaction will be done accordingly and with my position as the bill and  exchange guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately through my private e-mail  address: by indicating your bank name and address, Account number, phone and  fax number for easy communication. Upon your response, I shall then provide  you with more  details and that will help you understand the transaction and also give you the text of the application to fill and send  to the bank. Finally, You should observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured  that  this  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall  require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

September 12, 2006 September 12, 2006  Hello,  I am Mr. Huston J. Shoetan, an Account officer to Late Engr. Noah Neiman who used to work with Aramaz Oil Servicing and Construction Company Ltd. Before his death on the 20th of October 2003 (Engr. Noah Neiman with his Wife and three children were involved in a car accident along Gilam express road in which all occupants of the car died) Late Engr. Noah Neiman deposited the sum of US$7.2Million (Seven Million, Two Hundred Thousand US Dollars Only) with my bank with the hope of transferring the Fund to his country, during his annual leave, when it would be most convenient for him. Unfortunately, this fatal accident occurred and he could no longer receive his money. After several unsuccessful attempts and enquiries made to locate his relatives through your embassy and other means proved negative, I decided to trace his last name through the Internet by all means to locate any member of his family hence I contacted you. I contacted you even as you don&#8217;t bear the same last name with my late client, it is because of the time frame I have been given as his personal account officer to come up with his next of kin or have the funds confiscated. I will not want my government to confiscate this fund; hence I contacted you. I have the authority as his personal account officer to present any one to stand as his next of kin. I have employed the services of a reputable lawyer who is ready to work with us and there are also going to be legal documents that will be secured in your favor to back up this claim from the federal high court of law here by the lawyer.  I want you to assist in repatriating the fund left behind by Late Engr. Noah Neiman before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by my bank where these huge deposits were lodged and my bank had issued me (being his account officer) a notice to provide his next of kin or have the fund confiscated. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over some years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of this fund valued at US$7.2Million dollars can be released to you as the beneficiary. Then you and I can share the money - 70% to me, then 40% to you. I have arranged with a Lawyer to provide all necessary legal documents that will be used to back up this claim. There is no risk of any type in this business; I assure you in confidence.  All I require is your honest co-operation/trust to enable us seeing this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please I will require you send to me immediately your full names, your private phone and fax numbers and your address for immediate approval at the Court by Barrister Samuel Isetun in your name as the next of kin and beneficiary   of the money.  Please I will like you to send the required information so that Barrister Samuel Isetun can start up the process. I will also ask that you call me on telephone number: 234-8077088667 to confirm this so as to enable me contact Barrister Samuel Isetun whom will be fronting on your behalf in this regards so that he can proceed to the federal high court to start the process of securing all the legal documents that shall be used to back up this claims.   Please I will like to inform you that I will take full responsibility of any fee in this transaction so you do not have to spend anything. All I need is your   assistance to stand as the next of kin to my late client so that the money can be transferred into your account as the beneficiary.  Yours Sincerely,  Mr. Huston J. Shoetan.

I am (AZIZ KOFFI) a senior staff in file department in African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from a Yahoo Tourist Search. When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed  to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (friday december 26,2003  ) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death,  we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.  The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for ;me and my woman colleague. There after I and my colleague will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of  the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me on my number 00226 76 17 22 04.immediately as soon as you receive this letter. reply me with this e mail address aziz_koffi@latinmail.com immediately. Yours faithfully, AZIZ KOFFI POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As you finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well over this business.Please call me and inform me that you received my mail, because i don\'t go to net always. .........................................................................................

YSOUF AROUNA) AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT /FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT. AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B)OUAGADOUGOU -BF REQUEST FOR THE URGENT TRANSFER OF THE SUM (US$10.5million) ONLY INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. You may be surprise to receive this message from me since you don't know me in person, but for the purpose of introduction., I got your impressive information through an international business equiry . But I respectfully insist you read crefully as I am optimistic it will open doors for unimaginable financial reward for both us. This business transaction might not fall within the wide spectrum of your business activities ,but I plead your assistance ,as your flair for profitable business is needed . Permit me to introduce myself. I am MR. YSOUF AROUNA. the Manager of auditing and accounting unit at the foreign remittance department of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK . In My department I discovered an abandoned sum of$ 10.5m US dollars . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in november 2002 in a plane crash. Since I got information about his death, I have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because wecannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased anindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately I learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the planecrash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don?t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned bythe fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, inrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 %will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me . There after I will visit your country with my family for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted . On your acceptance, I will send to the text of application by fax or by email which you are going to apply to the bank ; and provide materials confirmation references and inquiries regarding payment formalities from the payment Agency. I willbe handling official protocols here and expect you to undertake international responsibilities as I am assuring you of a risk free transaction provided you display maturity. Therefore, if you are willing and interested to render the needed assistance, endeavor to reply through my email address . Thanking you in anticipation of your kind considerations. Yours sincerely.

Smith, deputy senior regional manager at Lloyds TSB Commercial Finance in Yorkshire. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.  On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at US$40,000,000.00, (forty Million, Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his employers, that Mr. Barry Kelly died from tsunami on his holidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$40,000,000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safekeeping.  No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British Law, at the expiration of (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am writing you because I as a public servant (Manager with the bank), I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.  I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the as the owner of the boxes.  The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.  If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.  Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in (Buying of properties like houses, hotels and doing charity works etc)  Please do send me your private/mobile telephone fax number so that we can have a smooth communication.  Awaiting your urgent reply ONLY via my email ( ttss7520062006@mixmail.com )  Thanks and regards.

I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On feb 27, 2001, a British Oil Consultant/contractor with the South African Mining Corporation, (Name deliberately with held) made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$50,000,000.00 (Ffity Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South African Mining Corporation, that the depositor died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that  the depositor did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,US$50,00,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Republic of South Africa,at the expiration of 5(five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the  fund.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as THE NEXT OF KIN to the depositor so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the Necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60%for me and 35% for you and 5% for any expenses that we are going to incue.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address.Upon your response, I shall then  provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your full name,address, confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.Also,Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank  treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this  business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a  Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of  this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision  of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the  business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague.

We were    married for  eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for  only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. Since his  death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home  which the Bible is against.  When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$10.5 Million (Ten  Million five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with A Bank Presently, this    money is  still under the safe keeping of the Reserve FINANCE COMPANY Recently,    my Doctor  told me that I would not last for the next SEVEN months due to my cancer  problems.  Though what disturbs me most is my stroke.Having known my condition, I decided  to donate this fund to church or better still a Christian or muslim individual  That will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a  church that will use this fund on, orphanages, deaf and domb and poor widows  propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.  The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took  this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and  my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard  earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this  money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold  decision.  I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going  to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight  my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in  this regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband's  relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development.

I want you and    the church  to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd,you will also promise me  that you will not seat on the fund when it gets into your bank account. My  happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to  serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth.

The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that  if such money remained  unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank   treasury as unclaimed fund.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I now  decided to make this  business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or  relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since  nobody is  coming for it and we don't want this  money to  go  into the bank  treasury as   unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that  if such money remained  unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank   treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner  as next of kin in this  business is occasioned by the fact that the customer  was a foreigner and a Burkina cannot stand as  next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 45% of this money will be for you  as  respect to the provision of a foreign account , 5% will be set aside for  expenses incurred during the  business and 50% be for me. Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the  percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this   fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the  bank as relation or   next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account   number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be  transfer. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by  fax or email the text of  the application. I will not fail to bring to your  notice that this  transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear  as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should  contact me immediately as soon as you  receive this mail, Trusting to hear from you immediately. Yours faithfully.

My name is Mohamed Zahir With my sister Amina,The Son and Daughter of (Late Dr Mohamed Abdel) Who lost his life in the course of the crisis  in my country Cote  D'ivoire on the 7th of May last year on his way to the company ( Nestle  Food Plc).

(2) That upon request for the release of the fund, there must be  evidence of investment intentions especially outside the west Africa,  We contact you therefore to confirm if you can absorb us in partnership in your company or possibly advise us on any investment opportunity in your country.

Our Regard,  Mohamed Zahir & Sister Amina ", 'GOOD DAY CHINA MERCHANT BANK. DES BOUEX RD. BRANCH, CENTRAL HONG KONG, HONK KONG.  NOTIFICATION AS NEXT OF KIN/BENEFICIARY  DATE: 18/10/2006 I am Mr.Joseph Yun, credit officer of the China Merchant Bank.I have a  concealed business suggestion for  you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war, our client Gen.Talfik Haddad who was  with the Iraqi forces and also business  man made a numbered fixed  deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Three Million,Six   Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war. Again after the war another notification  was sent and still  no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his  family had been  killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home. After further investigation it was also discovered  that the General did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the  paper work of his bank  deposit.   And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in  my bank. So, Twenty Three Million,Six Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is  still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it.  What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my  country at the expiration three years the funds  will revert to the ownership  of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this  backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as  a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to  Gen.Talfik Haddad so that you  will be able to receive his funds.  WHAT IS TO BE DONE: I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we  shall come out successful.  I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document  that will back you up as the next of  kin to the late General,all that is  required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full   Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of  kin,the attorney will also file  in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and  letter of  probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that  will be provided by you.  There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a  legalized method and the attorney  will prepare all the necessary  documents.   Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning  this issue. Once the funds have  been transferred to your nominated bank account we  shall share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you  and 5%for any  expenses incurred during the course of this operation.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his  supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash  leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery  that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this  businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or  relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody  is coming for it and we don;t want this money to go into the Bank treasury  as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclamed after three years, the money will be transfered into the Bank  treasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin  in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 40 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in  respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for  expenses incured during the business and 50 % would be for ;me and my  colleagues.

Presently I'm with   my lap top in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for cancer   of the lungs. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told   me that I have only a few months to live. It is my last wish to see that   this money is invested to any organization of your choice and distributed   each year among the charity organization, the poor and the motherless   baby&#65533;s home where I come from.

MR. SIMON WONG DAH SING BANK LTD. 19 DES VOEUX RD. CENTRAL HONG KONG, HONK KONG. I am Mr.Simon Wong credit officer of the Dah Sing Bank Ltd. I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war, our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home. After further investigation it was also ?discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank.So, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration three years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE: I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen.Ibrahim Moussa,all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job.After you have been made the next of kin,the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 60% for me, 35% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy Communication and i will provide you with more details of this operation.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank  treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned bythe  fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next  of kin to a foreigner.

Bashir and his party have controlled the government since he led the military coup on 30 June 1989.  The Darfur conflict erupted in early 2003. Fighting among various factions has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced more than 2 million, most escaping to larger towns where they stay in camps for "internally displaced people," and some crossing the border into Chad, where they live in refugee camps, straining local resources. Attacks on civilians during the conflict have been brutal and include burning homes, killing and rape. There has been signed a Darfur Peace Agreement between some of the parties in Darfur. This agreement is supervised by African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS), though the war is still going on. Before the escalation of the war I was a VOLUNTIER SOCIAL WORKER and during my duties one of the local army Commander who was wounded in battle and dying from the wound handed over to me documents showing the sum of Twelve Million United States Dollars (US$12 Million) sent overseas mainly for purchasing foods, pharmaceutical drugs, Clothings etc for millions of Southern Sudanese refugees who have been impoverished, battered and displaced by years of Civil war in our lands.

I would send copy of a POWER OF ATTORNEY given to me by the Late Commander which I would send alongside copies of my INTERNATIONAL PASSPORT and a second Power of Attorney to you that would enable you claim the funds from the Financial Institution upon your agreement and readiness to assist us.  I wish to repeat here and also wish to remind you of the TOP SECRECY this transaction requires, as I expect your positive response through this above Email address as my movement is presently restricted by law covering Political Refugees, though I might give you a telephone number later where you can talk with me.

I am 70 years old, a  British living in West Africa. I am a businessman and own two companies  here in Ouagadougou, married with two children. My wife and two  children died in a car accident six years ago but before this happened  my business and concern for making money was all I lived for I never  really cared about other values in life but since the loss of my  family, I have found a new desire to assist helpless families.   I  have been helping orphans in motherless homes, I have donated some  money to orphans in Sudan, America and some Asian countries. Before I  became ill, I kept some money, Ten million,three hundred thousand  dollars (US$10.3million) to be precise in a long term deposit account  in a Bank.  Presently, I'm in a hospital my doctor told me I have  prostate cancer that I have a few months to live. It is my last wish to  see this money distributed to charity organizations. Because so much of  my wealth has been plundered by relatives and friends since my illness,  hence I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge  responsibility to any of them since the money in the Bank is the last  fund that I have left. Right now I am partially stranded in the  hospital due to the nature of my sickness so I am appealing to you to  help me collect the deposit from the Bank and distribute it amongst  charity organizations.  I would want you to use your discretion to  distribute the money and keep 20% of it for yourself. Feel free to  reimburse yourself when you have the money for any cost you might have  incurred during the process of collecting and distributing the money to  charity organizations. May the good Lord bless you and your family. if  you are interested to proceed with this project go ahead and forward  the below information so that I will instruct you on how to proceed: Your Full Names: Your Direct Telephone Number: Your Fax: Your  Occupation: Your Nationality: Your Age: Please reply to this mail as  I can only communicate through my laptop which is by my bed, as soon as  I get the above listed information, I shall then give you the necessary  information you need to collect this money.

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $U.S15.5Million dollars (fifteen million five hundred thousand US dolloars)  in an account that  belongs to one of our foriegn customer who died along with his entire family in November 2004  in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking  guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside  with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidling here stipulates that  if such money remained unclaimed after six years the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.  The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned by the fact  that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect  to the  provision of a foriegn account, 10% will be set aside for expenses occured during the business and 60% would be for me and my colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement according  to the percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch  -free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you recieve this letter. Yours faithful Bill & Exchange Manager.

In the capital  city of Cotonou Benin republic, and assistance, this is a very confidential  proposition for you. On April 21st 1999, A Swedish Oil consultant/contractor  with the Benenoise Solid Minerals Corporation, Mr.Soren Anderson made a  numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at  US$15,000,000.00 (fifteen Million Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity on  November 20th 2003 as his Credit Officer, I sent a routine notification to his  forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and  finally I discovered from his contract employers, the Benenoise Solid Minerals  Corporation that Mr.Soren Anderson died on auto accident with his entire  family.  Further investigations and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.  Again, I made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Soren Anderson did  not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his  Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$15,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank No one will ever come  forward to claim it. According to the International Banking ethics, codes and  Laws, at the expiration of 7(Two) years, the money will revert to the ownership  of the Benin Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as  the next of kin to Mr.Soren. This is simple, I will like you to respond  immediately with your full names and address so that we will prepare the  necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of  kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of  70% for me and some of my colleagues who are aware of this transaction and 25%  for you and 5% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the transaction There is  no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by my  colleagues and with my position as the Foreign Remittance Director guarantees  the successful execution of this transaction.  Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant  documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your  confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. You should  observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would  be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to  invest my share in your country.

Since we got information about his death, we have  been expecting his next  of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless    some body applies for it as next of kin or relation  to the deceased as   indicated in our banking guide lines and lawsbut  unfortunately we learnt  that all his supposed next of kin or relation died  alongside with him at  the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now  decided to make this  business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or  relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since  nobody is  coming for it and we don't want this  money to  go  into the bank  treasury as   unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that  if such money remained  unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank   treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner  as next of kin in this  business is occasioned by the fact that the customer  was a foreigner and a Burkina cannot stand as  next of kin to a foreigner.

I want a church that will use thisfund on,  orphanages, deaf and dumb and poor widows propagating the word of God  and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.The Bible made us to  understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit  this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want  my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't  want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner.  Hence the reason for taking this bold decision.

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South African Mining Corporation, that the depositor died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that  the depositor did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,US$50,00,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the Necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer.

I am writing to notify you of the TESTAMENT of one or our Client who unfortunately lost his life in the Madrid bomb blast on March 11, 2004, killing over two hundred people including tourists in Spain. He was a prominent business leader who had been in Spain for vacation with his wife and their only daughter.  The deceased who was residing in the United States of America before his death made a deposit of Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$15,500,000.00) in Amsterdam Netherlands, his effort to avoid the obligatory payment of income tax in the United States of America. However, I was mandated by our team of professionals to search for the relatives of the deceased regarding his deposit as the holding financial institution wants him to come forward for the endorsement of the reinvestments documents on interest accrued. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his Next of Kin or relatives to come over to sign the reinvestment documents or claim his deposit because the financial institution cannot release these funds unless a formal application is made which is in line with the Royal Dutch law on inheritance claim. Regrettably, I learnt that his supposed Next of Kin, which could be his spouse or his only daughter died along with him in the ugly Madrid Bomb Blast leaving nobody with the knowledge of this huge deposit except me as the personal lawyer attached to monitor his deposit. It is in this regard that I and my colleagues decided to solicit your assistance by presenting you as the next of kin to the deceased. Although, we have agreed on the following sharing ratios: 25% for your assistance and 75% for me and my colleagues but it is still negotiable. NB: This transaction is very confidential and 100% risk free as I have a copy of his LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT which I can present your name as the TRUSTEE & EXECUTOR. This transaction shall be executed under legitimate and legal procedures that will protect you from any breach of the Law. Therefore, do not hesitate to revert back to me, either via fax or email, with the following details if my proposal interests you:  A signed copy of this letter, your address and your telephone and fax numbers.

The banking law and guidline here  stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the  bank treasury as unclaimed fund.

Dear friend, I am a staff of Private Banking Services at the Bank of China (BOC). I am contacting you concerning our customer and, an investment placed under our banks management 3 years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail. I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. In 2002, the subject matter; ref: bb/boc/bank/0012 came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services Department. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 8.35 million United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over (invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the Private Banking Services Department, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over 10 million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments.  In mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Europe. He directed that I liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm. I informed him that the bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across borders has become especially strict since the incident of 9/11. I contacted my affiliate in and had the funds available.  I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security consultancy firm, the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was deposited. He told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had, this transpired around 9th October 2004. In January this year, we got a call from the security firm informing us that the inactivity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit , and I could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit. I made futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of the bank of china. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently he was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Canne, South of France. We were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; he died intestate. In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. The investigation did not ever yield any result My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation.  This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, the firm will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to BOC, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back to BOC. This will result in the money entering the BOC accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the Private Banking Services Department. This will not happen if I have my way. What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose. There is US$ 8,370,000.00 deposited, I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as BOC is concerned, the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent the funds to the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process. They are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man's family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal;  I am prepared to place you in a position to give instruction for the release of the  deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50. I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the customer I will then officially communicate with the  firm  and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the firm.  We can fine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move.  Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in total control of my destiny. These chances won't pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am the only one who knows of this situation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let's share the blessing. If you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this same email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through this email address. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man; I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have learned from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, send me your response on this email fsh1953@yahoo.com.cn to enable us commences this line of discussion.

My dear.  greetings from miss Fatoumata Saleeby.  I am writting this letter with due respect and heartful of tears since we have not known or met ourselves previously, I am asking for whom to love and love me as well after I have gone through your profile and i just pick interest on you.  I am fair in complexion, I am about 5fit 7in tall, I love sport events, going outdoors activities, watching of moving, shopping, walking etc.In a nutshell, My name is Miss Fatoumata Saleeby 22 years old from the republic of Liberia in west Africa, now seeking for refugee in Dakar-Senegal under the (UNHCR).  I therefore write to inform you that I am the only surviving child and daughter of the deceased Dr. ELIE E. SALEEBY the former MINISTER OF FINANCE / EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CENTRAL BANK OF LIBERIA in the year July 1997-Feb. 2003.  The reason for this correspondence is to formally request for mutual assistance on business relationship with you in order to benefit from your wealth of experience in business.  The secret fact therefore, is that my father kept the sum of US$4,700, 000.00 (Four million seven hundred thousand US Dollars) CASH. The money was deposited at Bank here in Dakar Senegal.  The money is the share of proceeds from a deal executed with my father's colleagues in the hierarchy of membership of the LIBERIAN JOINT PUBLIC TENDER BOARD during a contract award to an Ukrainian - RUSSIA Diamond Extracting Company when my father was a chairman.  Due to the civil war caused by rebel leader Charles Taylor who has just been toppled by another rebel group and my father's status as a civil-servant by law in my country and the sensitivity of my father's position that attracts public attention, he cannot operate a Domiciliary account in order to keep this large sum of money in a bank in my country.  My father retired and died lately before he could withdraw this money here in and transfer it out of Africa. I anticipate to conclude arrangement to start this venture with you as quick as possible.  Due to my youthful age and also refugee here in senegal, decide to claim the money now with a foreign partner.  Upon your indicated interest, we will arrange for a meeting in the country of your choice when the money is moved from the Bank to your account and discuss in details the terms of agreement. I want to invest in any company that you suggest under your professional guidance.  Please include your private mobile telephone number in your reply for easy communication.  I earnestly await your urgent response as I expect you to treat this matter with required maturity, attention and committment.  with best regards  Fatoumata Saleeby.  v ", 'BUSINESS ASSISTANT DEAR SIR,  With due respect and humility I send you this mail.

JERRY BERRY THE MANAGER OF AUDIT AND ACCOUNTING DEPT, BANK OF AFRICA (BOA) OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA-FASO. I MAKE THIS APPEAL WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ANY FACTS OR OPINION EXPRESSED BY ME ARE GIVING IN CONFIDENCE AND SOLELY FOR YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND USE. I am DR. JERRY BERRY the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my Bank. In my department I discovered an abandoned  sum of US$12.5M,(Twelve Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with  account number 14-2558-5976 that belongs to one of our foreign customers who  died along with his wife and only daughter in a plane crash of Alaska  Airlines Flight number 261 which crashed on 31 January, 2000. You can read  more about the crash on visiting this site  http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/ The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great  industrialist and a resident of Alaska. It is therefore upon this discovery  that I now decided to make this  business proposal to you and for our bank  to release the money to you. You have to follow the instruction which I will  send to you as the next of  kin or relation to the deceased for safety and  subsequent disbursement  since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this  money to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money  remained  unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the bank  treasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than four years  and I am preparing documentaion to prove that this money has been transfered  to our bank treasury. It will be between me and you only  that will know  that the money is not transfered into our treasure. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by  the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabé cannot stand as  next of kin to a foreigner.In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering  you 30% of the total  sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other  charges) likely to be incurred during the course of transaction, while the  remaining 65% is for me. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email  the text of  the application which you will complete and forward to our bank asking for  this money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thomson. I  will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free  and that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have  been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you  receive this mail through the above email. PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY  YOU CONSIDER MY URGENT  REQUEST. Yours Faithfully, DR.

I have urgent and very confidential business  proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit  for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at US$40,000,000.00,  (forty Million, Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address  but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we  discovered from his employers, that Mr. Barry Kelly died from tsunami on his  holidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further investigation, I found out  that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin  was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry  Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,  including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of  US$40,000,000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for  Safekeeping .No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British Law, at  the expiration of (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of  the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the  owner  of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes  though  the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I  tagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am writing you because  I as a public servant (Manager with the bank), I cannot operate a foreign  account or have an account that is more than $1m. I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company  so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is  simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so  that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in  place as the as the owner of the boxes. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me  and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this  transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the  successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address  upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant  documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall  require your assistance to invest my share in (Buying of properties like  houses, hotels and doing charity works etc) Please do send me your private/mobile telephone fax number so that we  can have a smooth communication. Awaiting your urgent reply ONLY via my email( ttss7520062006@mixmail.com ) Thanks and regards. TONY SMITH', 'TRUSTING TO HEAR FROM YOU SOON FROM:MR.MUSTAFA ALI AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT.

FEDERAL MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM AND MINERAL RESOURCES. FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA, LAGOS, NIGERIA WEST AFRICA. ATTN: Please reply to:danielibe1616@yahoo.com.au Dear Friend, RE:REQUEST FOR URGENT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP IN RESPECT OF THE TRANSFER OF $25,500,000.00(TWENTY-FIVE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED AMERICAN DOLLARS)INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. I,on behalf of my other colleagues from different Federal Government of Nigeria owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as regards the transfer of the above stated amount into your bank account. This  fund arose from the overinvoicing of various contracts awarded in my  parastatal to certain foreign contractors sometime ago. We as holders of sensitive positions in our various parastatal, were mandated by the federal government to scrutinise all payments made to foreign contractors, and discovered that some of the contracts they executed were grossly over invoiced, either by omission or commission. Also, we discovered that the sum of $33,000,000.00(thirty three million American dollars only) was lying in a suspense account, although the foreign contractors were fully paid their entitlements after executing the said contracts. We all agreed that the over-invoiced amount be transferred into a bank  account provided by a foreign partner, as the code of conduct of federal civil service does not allow us to operate foreign accounts. However, we have suceeded in transferring some of the monies, precisely US$7.5(Seven million five Hundred American Dollars) into a foreign account in united State of America,but unfortunately the provider of the account has severed all forms of communication with us as he has refused to adhere to our earlier mutual agreement, insisting that the total amount be paid into his nominated bank account before disbursement will take effect. We are therefore seeking your assistance based on the balance amount US$25.5M which can be speedily processed and fully remitted into your nominated bank account. On successful remittance of the funds into your account, you will be compensated with 20% of of the amount for your assistance and services. This transaction is closely knitted and in view of our sensitive positions we cannot afford a slip. I assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free.We will avail you with our identities as regards our respective office when relationship is fully established and smooth operation commences. I am at your disposition to entertain any questions from you in respect of this transaction, so,  contact me immediately through the above email address for further information on the requirements and procedure. Please note that this is a DEAL and confidentiality is of very great importanceb for security reasons. Please treat with strict confidenlity and utmost urgency. N.B: Your telephone and fax numbers are needed for easy communication. Best regards, DR.Daniel Ibe.

I want a church that will use this fund on, orphanages, deaf and dumb and poor widows propagating the word of God  and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.The Bible made us to  understand that blessed is the hand that giveth.I took this decision  because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my  husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard  earned money to be misused by unbelievers.

', "From: Mr.Al-Zarqawi Yusuf  From: Mr.Al-Zarqawi Yusuf Dear Friend, Your first reaction to this mail will be total rejection, scare and maybe disbelief, owning largely to the atrocities people commit these days.But this mail comes from a devastated, sorrowful and emotional laden soul that needs compassion from a kind and good spirited person to wipe away my tears and appropriate my dream and humanitarian gesture. As you read this, I don't want you to  feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone dies someday.,I am Al-Zarqawi Yusuf, A Oil merchant in Dubai, United Arab Emirate ( UAE). I have been diagnosed with Cancer, which was discovered very late, due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all forms of medicine; Right now I have only about a limited to live, according to my Medical Doctor. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for myself but the Oil business.Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when Allah  gives me a second chance and  heal me I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for my healing I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends. i want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have decided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and comfort to the less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, by distributed some of this money to some charity organizations in India,Hurricane Katrina victims in USA and other part of the world. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self anymore.I once asked members of my family  to close one of my accounts in Saudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization and to the less  privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan.  They cashed the money but kept it only to themselves. Hence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them already.The last of my money, which no one knows of, is the huge cash deposit of Thirty Five Million United States Dollars ( US$35Million)  that I have in the Vault of The Security Company as family valuable since the year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect this deposit on my behalf and disburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake victims in Asia for the less privileged. Please send me a mail to indicate your wiliness to assist in this disbursement.  I will set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts by notifying the security company as soon as i hear from you.I need your urgent reply with your full name and address, your Phone and Fax numbers and your Occupation so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible person to handle this project for himself and the rest of the less privileged.I will also plead to you to always pray for me because only Allah heals.

I am the Executive Investigation Chairman Committee on Review of Contracts Payments instituted by H.E.

I have been mandated by my colleagues on the Committee to seek your assistance in the transfer of the sum of US$31.5Million.  As you may know, the late General Abacha and members of his government embezzled billion of dollars through spurious contracts and payments to foreigners between 1993-1998, and this is now the subject of probe by my Committee. In the course of our review, we have discovered the sum of US$31.5Million,which the former dictator could not transfer from the dedicated account of the Central Bank of Nigeria before his sudden death on June 8, 1998. It is this amount that my colleagues and I have decided to acquire for ourselves through your assistance. This assistance becomes crucial because we cannot acquire the fund in our names.  We have thus developed a, fool proof, legal and totally risk free arrangement through which the fund can be transferred within a very short time, if you follow strictly our instructions. The plan is to use our position and influence on the Committee to present you as a foreign contractor beneficiary of the fund. We shall arrange all documentation to support this claim and get Approval for the transfer of the funds for your benefit on our behalf.

Thanks   Harrison Justain   www.himage.com,   Corporate Headquater   12 HARWELL GROOVE   WINFORD CHESHIRE   CUM 3UR UNITED KINGDOM   __________________________________________________  To: R@S ", "LETTER Dear Friend,  With great pleasure I Mr. Donald Ofu Obidima, Credit control Manager of  a Bank (name upheld)is writing you in respect of a foreign customer an  Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum  corporation,Engr.Lee Seunghyo made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for  twelve calendar months valued  at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address  but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we  discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum  Corporation that Engr.Lee Seunghyo died in Korean Air Flight 801, which  crashed in Guam on August 1997 with other passengers onboard. I  therefore made further investigation and discovered that Engr. Lee  Seunghyo died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next  of kin was fruitless.Also, he did not declare any next of kin  or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit  paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my  Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the  end of each year.  Since the demise of this our customer, I have personally watched the  account with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved  abortive as no one has come to claim his FIXED DEPOSIT fund of  USD.$25million, [Twenty five million United States Dollars] which has  been with my branch for a very long time. Since his  death, none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward to lay  claims for this money asthe heir.  A member of our government trade delegation to your country gave your  impeccable profile to me. Hence I have decided to seek your co-operation  in this business deal due to the sensitivity of this transaction. It may  interest you to know that I am only contacting you as a foreigner  because this money cannot be approved to a local Bank account here, but  can only be approved to a foreigner with an account since the money is  in US Dollars. I have decided as a matter of urgency upon this discovery  now seek your permission to have you stand as next of kin to the  deceased Engr. Lee Seunghyo as No one has ever come forward to claim  this fund.  In accordance to Nigerian Law, fund deposited for a long period of time  without claim will be reverted to the Nigerian Government treasury if  nobody applies to claim this fund after a long period of time. I want  you to co-operate with me so that the fruits of this man's labour will  not get into the hands of some unsrupulous corrupt government officials  if NOT CLAIMED now. I have secured from the probate an Order of Madamus  to locate any of deceased beneficiaries. Hence I am contacting you with  this proposal.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately the following  below:  1.full names and address  2.Date of Birth  3.Tel & Fax Numbers  So that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits  which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the  services of two Attorneys for drafting and notorization of the WILL and  to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration  in your favour for the transfer.  The Bank cannot release the fund from his account unlesssomeone applies  for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking  guidelines. I have almost resolved to finalize this transaction with  some money to secure documents in your name as the bonafide beneficiary  of this fund $25m which guarantees our safety and successful transfer.  With the above suggestion, It is reliable,safe and quick for transfer  process.  At the successful conclusion of this business, your goodself shall be  entitled to have 40% that is, USD$10m of the total money while I will  have 55% that is USD$13.750m and 5% that is USD$1.250m for  communications and other expenses. I am ready to invest a reasonable  percentage of mine into any viable business you suggest as a joint  partner.  Your response is highly imperative as this is a TWO-man business deal  transaction as I shall then provide you with more details and relevant  documents that will help you understand the transaction. I need your  assistance and co-operation to this reality as I have done my Home-work  and fine tune the best way to create you as all the paperwork for this  transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch  Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction with you  as the beneficiary to this fund. Your percentage will also be a source  of upliftment.You have absolutely nothing to LOSE in assisting me  instead, you have so much to GAIN. Be rest assured that this transaction  would be most profitable for both of us.  I will appreciate your early reply for commencement of business.Contact  me for acknowledgement by E-mail and whereby you are not interested,  please indicate in your reply so that I can seek for the assistance of  someone else.

But now I regret all this  as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make  all the money in the world.  I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would  live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has  called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my  immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.  I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to  give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the  last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some  charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my  health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.  I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and  distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in  Bulgaria and Pakistan,they refused and kept the money to themselves.  Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with  what I have left for them.  The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of  Eighteen Million Dollars $18,000,000,00 in side two boxes that I have  with a Finance/Security Company Abroad. I will want you to Act as my  Beneficiary who will help me contact the security finance company on my  behalf to discuss the terms and condition of getting this deposit out from  thier custody and also helping me to dispatch it to the charity  organisations.  Reply to this email with your full names,contact address,tel number and  fax to enable me ask my doctors lawyer to arrange for you a power of  attorney that will give you full legal backing as my beneficiary.  I have set aside 30% for you and for your time.

I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit  for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at US$40,000,000.00, (forty Million, Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his employers, that Mr. Barry Kelly died from tsunami on his holidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$40,000,000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for Safekeeping .No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British Law, at the expiration of (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the owner  of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though  the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am writing you because I as a public servant (Manager with the bank), I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m. I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the as the owner of the boxes. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in (Buying of properties like houses, hotels and doing charity works etc) Please do send me your private/mobile telephone fax number so that we can have a smooth communication. Awaiting your urgent reply ONLY via my email( ttss7520062006@mixmail.com ) Thanks and regards. TONY SMITH', "Mrs Aicha Ahmed, TREAT VERY URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL. CALL ME 0022676743842.  My Dear, I am Mrs Aicha Ahmed, the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign  remittance department Bank Of Africa. In my department we discoveredan abandoned sum of US$14.5M (fourteen million  five hundred thousand US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our  foreign customer who died along with his family in the 2003 in a plane  crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guide lines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the  plane crash leaving nobody behindfor the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is  coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed after four years, the money will be transferred into the bank  treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by  the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkina cannot stand as  next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 45% of this money will be for you as respect to the provision  of a foreign account , 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the  business and 50% be for me. Thereafter, I will visit your country fordisbursement according to the  percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this  fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your  bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number  for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be  transfer. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of  the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this  transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear  as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail,Trusting  to hear from you immediately. Yours faithfully. Mrs Aicha Ahmed.

I am Mr.Huang Yanxiong credit officer  of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for  you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General.Ibrahim Umar who was  with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit  for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty million Five Hundred  Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several  notices was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after  the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him.  We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during  the war in bomb blast that hit their home.  After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Umar  did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper  work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was  at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So,  Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying  in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me  most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration  three years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong  Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my  suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the  next of Kin to Gen. Ibrahim Umar so that you will be able to receive his  funds.  WHAT IS TO BE DONE:  I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall  come out successful.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank's  treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of  foreigner as next of kin in this  business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a  Burkinabe cannotstand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 40 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in  respect to the provision of a foreign account,  10 % will be set aside for expenses incurred during the  business and 50 % would be for me and my colleague. There after I will visit  your country for disbursement of the fund according to the percentages  indicated in this proposal. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of  this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations  or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account  number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location  where in the money will beremitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by email the text of the  application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction  is hitch free and that you  should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer . You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.

Let me introduce myself to you before I go further; I am Mr. mark Abdul the son of late Mr. Abdul Kosoko who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I wouldn\'t go much deep detailing the problem I am having in my own country Zimbabwe, but you can have a look on This web-site;http://www.rte.ie/news/2000/0418/zimbabwe. html, if you have the time you will understand the kind of brutal president we have. Before the sudden death of my father, he foresees the looming danger in Zimbabwe and decided to make a deposit SUM OF$30 MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS(THIRTY MILLION US DOLLARS)in disguise as consignment in a box with a Security Company in European  . And he was forced to disclose this to me alone as his first son. And with faith, I am going to disclose the details to you,  hoping that you will understand me and keep the secret to yourself, and most importantly to stand as the beneficiary to this fund, so that non of my country people we have any reason to track this money back.  This money was deposited as family valuables due to the heat of the problem in Zimbabwe , so that the government will not try to confiscate the money if discovered. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of a new farm in Swaziland . The land disputes started when Zimbabwean President "MR. ROBERT MUGABE" introduced a new Land Act reform which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers. This resulted to many killings by Zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land reformed Act for which my Father was one of the victims. And because of this development I flew to Dubai to stay as a refugee.  From the studies I have been able to make in Dubai concerning the right of a refugee, a lot of question will arise if I make any attempt to claim this fund directly concerning my age. And for the fact that I will not like to stay permanently in Dubai due to there law of not issuing permanent resident to foreigners. I am looking forward to stay in a country that the law will give me full right with time. And to have a good guardian that is knowledgeable in business and investment. It is just on this background that I have contacted you. Please, I need your assistance to transfer this fund to your trusted overseas bank account as soon as it is being claim from the Security Company. For your efforts and assistance, I have agreed to give you 30% of the total sum, while 10% is mapped out to re-in-burse all the expenses incurred in the course of this transaction and 60% will be for me and my family investment in your country under your kind control.  Note that this transaction is 100% clear and risk-free, as I have made every necessary arrangement for a successful deal base on the little advice my let father gave to me. The only thing am soliciting from you is the total assistance to make a claim of the fund on your name from the Security Company, and after which the money will be paid into your account in your country  I need your complete trust and assurance that my own part of money will be safe when transferred to your account. Kindly keep this business proposal highly confidential for security reasons. If you are interested in assisting me, Reply via the above email address and include your private phone and fax numbers. I will respond to you immediately.  Looking forward to your urgent reply, God Bless.  Sincerely Yours,  Mr. mark Abdul  Ahora también puedes acceder a tu correo Terra desde el móvil.

I am Isaac Baka, the site inspection director with the ministry ofworks and construction and I worked directly with the Minister in charge of the Ministry here in Republic of Sudan.     I awarded a contract to a firm worth several millions of dollars a few years ago. In the course of executing the project the firm discovered large gold deposit in one of the construction sites. Being the site director I collaborated with the firm in the mining of the gold on a mutual agreement to share the proceeds out of which I got a share of 7.5 Million.  As a civil servant in this small war torn country, I cannot introduce this funds into the banking system here considering my meager monthly income as well as the code of conduct guidelines regulating civil service here in my country, Sudan. Presently Sudan is engulfed in a civil crisis and as this crisis intensified by the day, I have decided to move this fund out for any profitable venture. The fund will be moved out of Sudan under diplomatic cover as soon as we conclude all procedure. I therefore solicit for your co-operation to take delivery of this fund into your custody for any profitable investment that will be mutually beneficial. I will be able to arrange all necessary procedures to ensure smooth movement of this funds until you are in control of it.

Good Day,  I am Mr. Chen Jiang, Bank Manager of a Bank in China.I have an urgent  and very confidential business proposition for you.On November 6, 2001,  a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese Solid Minerals  Corporation, Made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar  months, valued at US$30,000,000.00 (Thirty Million United States  Dollars) in my branch.Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to  his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  contract employers, the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation that he died  from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that  he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of  kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and  discovered that he did not declare any kin or relations in all his  official documents, including his Bank Depos! it paperwork  in my Bank. This sum of US$30,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank  and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end  of each year.  No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws ofRepublic  of China, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to  the ownership of the Chinese Government if nobody applies to claim the  fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner  to stand in as the next of kin to the man so that the fruits of this  old man's  labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government  officials.This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your  full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary  documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.  shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and authorization  of the WILL and to obtain the necessary doc! uments and letter of  probate/administration in your favor!  for the transfer.A bank account in  any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the  transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money  will be paid into your  account for us to share in the ratio of 50% for me and 50% for you.  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will  be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager  guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are  interested, please reply immediately via the private email address  chenjiang022@yahoo.com.hkUpon your response, I shall then provide you  with more details and  relevantdocuments that will help you understand the transaction. Please  send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy  communication.  Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall  require you! r assistance to invest my share in your country.  Awaiting your urgent reply via my email address.  chenjiang022@yahoo.com.hk  Thanks and regards.  Chen Jiang. ", '"work with me" Hallo friend,  This letter must surprise you because we have never meet before    neither in person nor by correspondence, but I believe that it takes    just one day to meet or know someone either physically or through    correspondence.  I got your contact through my personal search, you were revealed as    being quite astute in private entrepreneurship, and one has no doubt    in your ability to handle a financial business transaction. I am Mr.    Liu Yan a transfer supervisor operations in investment section in Bank    of China Ltd. Secretariat of the BOCHK Charitable Foundation 13/F.    Bank of China Tower, 1 Garden Road, Hong Kong I have an obscured    business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client    General Mohammed Jassim Ali who work with the Iraqi forces and also    business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months,    with a value of Nineteen million Five Hundred Thousand United States    Dollars only in my branch.  Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even early in the war.    Again after the war another notification was sent and still no    response came from him. We later find out that General Mohammed Jassim    Ali and his family had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that    hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that    General Mohammed Jassim Ali did not declare any next of kin in his    official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he    also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one    except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Nineteen million Five    Hundred Thousand United States Dollars is still lying in my bank and    no one will ever come forward to claim it.  What bothers me most is that, according to the to the laws of my    country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the    ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the    funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like    you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to General Mohammed    Jassim Ali so that you will be able to receive his funds.I want you to    know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out    successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the    necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to General    Mohammed Jassim Ali, all what is required from you at this stage is    for you to provide me with your Full Names, private phone number and    Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been    made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on    your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in    your favor for the transfer of the funds to an account that will be    provided by you with my guidiance.There is no risk involved at all in    the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney    will prepare all the necessary documents.  Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning    this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated    bank account we shall discuss the percentage issue on your reply.If    you are interested please send me your full names, private phone/fax    and current residential address, and I will prefer you to reach me on    my private and secure email address below (liuyan_1968@yahoo.com.hk)    and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this    operation.  Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

An Iraqi named Hamadi Hashem a business man made a numbered fixed deposit of (346,736,899.68 HKD) for 18 calendar months; this is valued to Forty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even during the war,four years ago (2003). Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later found out that Hamadi Hashem and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home at Mukaradeeb where his personal oil well was. After furtherinvestigation it was also discovered that Hamadi Hashem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paperwork of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank.So, Forty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it.What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration five years six months the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if no body applies to claim the funds. My proposal, I am prepared to place you as the next of kin in a position to instruct HANG SENG BANK to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds FIFTY - FIFTY. I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line in my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days.I will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to Hamadi Hashem I will then officially communicate with my Bank and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these:all is done. I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all  his supposed next of kin's or relation died alongside with him at the plane  crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is  coming for it and I don�t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as  unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed after some years, the money will be transferred into the Bank  treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by  the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkina citizen cannot  stand as next of kin to a foreigner. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this  country as a civil servant (A Banker), we are not allowed to operate any   foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the  time of transfer because I work in the same bank. This is the actual reason  why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the  next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will  need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after  due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank  where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank  account.

CALL ME 0022676743842 My Dear, I am Mrs Aicha Ahmed, the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign  remittance department Bank Of Africa. In my department we discoveredan abandoned sum of US$14.5M (fourteen million  five hundred thousand US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our  foreign customer who died along with his family in the 2003 in a plane  crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guide lines and laws but unfortunately we learnt  that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behindfor the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is  coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as  unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed after four years, the money will be transferred into the bank  treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by  the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkina cannot stand as  next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 45% of this money will be for you as respect to the provision  of a foreign account , 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the  business and 50% be for me. Thereafter, I will visit your country fordisbursement according to the  percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this  fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your  bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number  for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be  transfer. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of  the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this  transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear  as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail,Trusting  to hear from you immediately. Yours faithfully. Mrs Aicha Ahmed.

I have the pleasure to share my testimony with you, having seen your contact from the Internet. I am Barrister Martinez Obe, the legal adviser to late Mr.and Mrs.Grieves Martins a British couple that lived in my Country Nigeria for 25 years before they died in the Bellview plane crash . They are good Christian, They so dedicated to God but They had no child till they died.  Throughout their stay in my country, They acquired a lot of properties like lands, house properties, etc. As their legal adviser, before their death, They instructed me to write their WILL. Because they had no child, They dedicated their wealth to God. According to the WILL, the properties have to be sold and the money be given out to a ministry for the work of God, Orphanages and less privilegdes ones. As Their legal adviser, all the documents for the properties were in my care. They gave me the authority to sell the properties and give out the fund to the Ministries for the work of God.  In short, I sold all the properties after their death, as they instructed And as matter of fact, after I sold all their properties, I realized more than $10,000,000.00 (Ten million US dollars plus),and what supposed to be the percentage interest of my right legal fee was firstly deducted by me out of the total amount realized from the sold properties, this was base on the initial agreement between me and the owner of the properties before their death.  Therefore the total amount left to be invested into God\'s work as instructed by the owner, is $10,000,000.00 (Ten million US dollars) only. But Instead of giving the main fund out for the work of God as instructed to me by the owner before their death.  I converted the fund to myself with the intention of investing the fund abroad for my personal use. I was afraid of putting the fund in the Bank, because I have to give account to the bank on how I got the money. I then packaged the fund in consignments and deposited the consignments with a security company. I did not want the management of the Security Company to know the content of the consignments; therefore I registered the content of the consignments as Gold Bars. Now, the security company believes that what I deposited with them was Gold Bars.  I had encounter with Christ when Rev. Billy Graham was preaching on television concerning Ananias and Saphira in Acts 5:1-11. After hearing the word of God, I gave my life to Christ and became a born again Christian. As a born again Christian, I started reading my bible and one day, the Lord opened my eyes to Ezekiel 33: 18 and 19 where the word of God says: "When the righteous truth from his righteousness, and committee iniquity, he shall even die thereby. But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby". From the scripture, I discovered that the only way I could have peace in my life is to do what is lawful and right by giving out the fund as instructed for the work of God by the owner before her death.  I have asked God for forgiveness and I know that God have forgiven me. But I have to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God by giving out the fund to the chosen ministry for the purpose of God\'s work as instructed by the owner before her death. After my fasting and prayers, I asked God to make his choice and direct me to a honest Christian but after my fervent prayer over it, then you were nominated to me through divine revelation from God, so these are how I received such a divine revelation from the Lord, how I got your contact information, and I then decided to contact you for the fund to be used wisely for things that will glorify the name of God.  I have notified the Security Company where I deposited the consignments that contained the fund, that I am moving the consignment abroad and the security company has since been waiting for my authority for the consignment to leave my country and move to abroad. You should also forward to me your telephone and fax number for easy communication and to fax you the documents concerning the consignments.  prompt response will be highly appreciated.you can contact me on my secured e-mail address martinezobe84@keromail.com  Yours in Christ Barrister Martinez Obe.', 'THE ABOVE SUBJECT MATTER REFERS CONCERNING YOUR FUND.

I have a obscured business suggestion for you. I am a brother to Dr.Gerald Mekha,who worked with   Iraq Judicial Commission , Iraq, for over a decade before he died on 20th of March in the year 2007.  He died after a brief  illness that lasted for two weeks. Before his death he made a vow to use his wealth for the down trodden and the less privileged in the society. When my brother was alive he deposited the sum of £250 Million Pounds (Two Hundred and Fifty Million Pounds) with one United Kingdom Security Company in London.  This funds are still with the Security Company for the past 6 years now,the funds are locked in two metallic trunk boxes, deposited with these company, i am in a refugee camp here in Iraq, as a result of the war in   Iraq this moment, am sorry am not too fine based on my health,though what disturbs me most is my stroke.   Having known my condition and want to make sure i do my father's will, I have decided to donate this fund to an individual or company,that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein.   I want an individual or company that will use this to fund and provide succor to poor and indigent persons, orphanages, and widows and for propagating peace in the universe. I understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I do not have any one that will inherit this money and my staying in the refugee camp, still don't know when i'll be granted the visa permit out of Iraq. I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision.  I do not need any telephone communication in this regard because of my uneasy access to the facility in the refugee camp here in Iraq. Also because of the presence of social security in the camp, I do not want them to know. With Allah all things are possible.   As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact information of the Security Company in London,United Kingdom. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original beneficiary of this fund. I want you to always pray for me.  My happiness is that I lived a life worthy of emulation. Whosoever that wants to serve the Almighty Allah must serve him with all his heart and mind and soul and also in truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life.

CAN I TRUST YOU FOR THIS TRANSACTION? Attn: The President/MD. Sir, My name is Mr. James Smith. I trained and work as an external auditor for Abbey national bank - London, working as part of a bigger team that covers  the entire Uk region. I had taken pains to find your contact through personal endeavors. On routine audit check last month, I discovered some US$ investment accounts that had been dormant for the least twelve years. All the accounts belong to a single holder with monies totaling a little above $25.5 million United States Dollars plus interest. Banking regulation/legislation in the Uk demands that I notify the fiscal authorities after a statutory time period of twelve years when dormant accounts of this type are called in by the monetary regulatory bodies. The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing and making the following proposals. My investigations of the said account reveals that the investor died in 1994 and the exact time the account was last operated. I can confirm with certainty that the said investor died and no next of kin to his estate has been found or has come forward all these years. I am of the settled conviction that using my insider leverage, I, working with you can secure the  funds in the account for us instead of allowing it pass as unclaimed funds into the coffers of the Government of Great Britain,this is very possible. I want your participation and co-operation. I have seized all relevant documents  (legal and Banking) that will facilitate our putting you forward as the claimant/beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated by you. Of course you shall be handsomely rewarded for your part in this transaction as the people I am working with are prepared to allocate a 20% slice of the total funds for your efforts, less any expenses. I shall however leave out the finer details of this transaction till I receive an affirmation of your desire to participate. Be assured that my colleagues and I are on top of the situation all the time and there will be no risk whatsoever if you agree to come on board.

Email:kcole444@yahoo.co.uk ATTENTION: I am a member of Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP),London. ICEP is charged with the responsibility of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss indigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II.  It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by non-Swiss citizens.  These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims. The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP)have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant accounts -54 ,000 in December, 1999. The published lists contain all types of dormant accounts,including interest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit boxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. Numbered accounts are also included.Interest is paid on accounts that were interest bearing when established. The Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims on accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of Hami Ramzy with a credit balance of 15,800,000 US dollar plus accumulated interest was discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of theirs. The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by the law for management of assets of deceased benefi ciaries who died interstate living no wills). Being a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary contacts for claim of the funds without any hitch.  The funds will be banked in the Holland, London or Spain, being a safe for funds and we can share the funds and use in investment of our choice. Due to the sensitive nature of my job,  I need a foreigner to HELP claim the funds.

FROM THE DESK OF MASSAN AHMED BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER, BANK OF AFRICA (BOA) OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO. Dear Sir,               I am the manager of bill and exchange foreign remittance at  the department of Bank Of Africa (BOA). In my departmentn we discovered an abandone sum of $ 22.6 m US dollars  (Twenty two  Millon six hundred thousand  US dollars) . In an account that  belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family  in a concord plane crash in the year 2000 in paris that almost took the  whole life of the pasengeres on board. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his  supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash  leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my depar tment now decided to make this  businness proposal to you and release the  money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and  subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don;t want this  money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclamed after ten years, the money will be transfered into the Bank  treasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin  in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner  and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in  respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for  expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for ;me and my  colleagues. Thereafter I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement  accoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate  trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank  as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your  bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and  effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.    Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text  of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this  transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear  as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.  Trusting to hear from you immediately.

CAN YOU HELP US INVEST OUR LATE FATHER'S FUND????? Dearest Beloved, Please kindly go through this letter before you pass judgment because I am in  need of assistance from a God fearing and trustworthy person. I am Mr. Sayid Mustafa the son of late Dr. Malik Mustafa  from Sierra Leone. I must confess my agitation is real, and my words is my bond, in this  proposal My late father happens to be in control of a large number of farms including cattle’s and many sheep before he was poisoned by his foreign business partners in Paris with my mother in one of their farmers association meeting because of greed.  But before his death my late father deposited some amount of money outside our country in a bank at the tone of Four Million United States Dollars $4,000.000.00. So I and my little sister were no longer safe here as the present government of  Sierra Leone are working with almost all the  killers of my late father and were looking a way to kill us too as one of them has  just been made a minister, name undisclosed because of security reasons. Furthermore we have contacted the bank where the money was deposited and the bankers let us understand that they signed an agreement with our late father that the total money must be transferred into his foreign business partner account undisclosed to them ,therefore because of this reason the money will not be released to us until the foriegn partner of my late father comes for the claim of the money or we should present to them the partner of our late father and that is the major reason why i am contacting you now for assistance so that you can contact the bank as my late father's foriegn partner. All i need  from you now  if you have accepted  and willing to help us  when replying is your full names and address including your direct and personal telephone number for easy communication as you know that this transaction is a very confidential one and also assure me that you are really ready to assist us. Please Kindly get back to me immediately after you must have gone through my message fill free and make it urgent because we are in a very difficult situation now.

Dear Sir,  I am Mr Musatapha Accounts supervisor with National Bank,Freetown, Sierra   Leone. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On   June 6, 1999, a Foreign Diamond consultant/contractor with the Sierra Leonean   National Diamond Corporation, Mr.Simon Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed)   Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at SD$27,000,000.00, (Twenty-Seven   Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to   his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and   finally I discovered from his contract employers, the Sierra Leanean National   Diamond Corporation that Mr. Simon Kelly died from a rebel attack. On further   investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all   attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further   investigation and discovered that Mr. Simon Kelly did not declare any kin or   relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork   in my Bank. This sum of USD$27,000,000.00 has carefully/confidentially been   moved out of my bank to a Finance security company in the Gambia for   safekeeping. No one can ever come forward to claim it. According to Sierra   Leonean Law, at the expiration of 8 (eight) years,the money will revert to the   ownership of the Sierra Leone Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.   Consequently, my proposal is that I want you as a Foreigner to stand in as the   rightful owner of the money. I deposited it in a security company in two trunk   boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I   tagged them to be photographic materials for export. In the circumstance, I   want to present you as the rightful owner of the boxes in the security company   so that you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is   simple. I would like you to provide immediately your full names and address as   well as your direct telephone and fax number so that the Attorney will prepare   the necessary documents which will put you in the right place as the owner of   the boxes. The money will be moved out for us to your country and share in the   ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you. There is no risk at all as all the   paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will   guarantees the successful execution of this transaction on your behalf, please   reply immediately via my email address. Upon your response, I shall then   provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you   understand the transaction and swing into the necessary action while I confide   in you hoping you will not betray me at last.   Thanks and God bless      Mr Musatapha  ____________________  http://www.email.si/ ', 'FROM:RITA DOINK. FROM:RITA DOINK.

STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don't know me personally, the purpose of my introduction is that, I am MR.DAVID KUBA,the first SON of MR.PEDRO KUBA,a farmer and leader movement for Democratic change  (MDC)in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I was furnished with viable information from the International Trade Centre here in Johannesburg and I decided to  write to you. Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$40 M(FOURTY  MILLION  UNITED STATES DOLLARS),in a Security Company, as if he fore saw the  looming danger in Zimbabwe. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals  for the farms and the establishment of the new farms in Swaziland. This land problem  came when Zimbabwean President MR.ROBERT MUGABE introduced a new Land Act which  wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers.This resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. Infact, alot of people have been killed because of this land reformed Act for which my father was one of the victims. It is against this  background, that I and my family who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my father's  money to foreign account since the law of South Africa prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction. As the eldest SON of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money  in South Af rica  for fear of going through the same experience  in future since both countries have similar political history. Moreover,the South  African Foreign Exchange policy  does  not allow such investment as an  asylum seeker. As a business man,whom I have entrusted my future and of my family in his hands,I must let  you know that this transaction is risk free. If  you accept to assist me and my family. will aid us in transferring the money into any account you will nominate overseas. This money I intend to use for investment. I have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have a certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Which ever the option you want, feel free to notify me as I  have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the proccess of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money while the remaining 75% will be for my investment in your country. Contact me with the above telephone number while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction. And no matter the level of transaction we are, you must call me on phone first before sending a reply. Please, You should keep this transaction secret and confidential. And send your fax and telephone numbers for easy communication. N/B.I would like you to furnish me with the following: 1) YOUR PRIVATE PHONE AND FAX NUMBERS. 2) YOUR FULL NAME. 3) YOUR FULL ADDRESS.

I am writing this letter to you to intimate you  of a pending transaction I want to execute with you privately. Anyway I got your  contact through one of the Internet Reference Directories in my Chambers. One of my valued clients - Mr. Antonio Montoya died together with his lovely  wife Late Antonio Montoya died on the Flight 11, a Boeing 767-200, which was  enroute to Los Angeles from Boston during the terrorist attack on America back  in 2001.   I was his personal lawyer and the Executor of his Will. There is no  further traces of any of his next-of-kin in his native Country. As his personal lawyer and Executor of his Will, I know late Antonio Montoya  kept about GBP 9.2 million in the Vaults of a bank here in London.  This money  had been taken to the bank late on the evening of his departure to USA, hence  the money was only accepted  and registered by the bank while it was kept in the  Vault waiting for Montoya's return, which was never to be.   I have sinceconfirmed  with the bank that the money is still in the bank's vault. Ever since 2001 this  money has been in this account untouched!    Now,how do you come in and what is your business with all this?  I am sure this  is the question you would be asking me?   Simple, As the personal lawyer to late  Antonio Montoya and since vital document relating to this money is kept with my  Chambers, I decided that I intimate you of this development, with your  co-operation, I can present you to bank as the Next-of-Kin to the late Antonio  Montoya.   After proper verification of this Claim by the bank this money will be  transferred to your bank account hence you come in as the Next-of-Kin to late  Antonio Montoya. How do we do it?  The document showing that this money is kept in the bank's  vault is kept in my Law Chambers.   I, as the lawyer and Executor of late Antonio  Montoya's Will/Last Testament will put your name in this Will as the Beneficiary  of this money kept in the bank's vault.   I will submit the Will/Last Testament to  the Bank to contact you and start processing transfer of this money to your bank  account according to the last wishes of my Client - late Mr. Montoya for further  administration to other members of the family.   I am the Executor of late  Montoya's Will. All I need to do is to re-make the late Mr. Montoya's Will/Last Testament to  include your name as the beneficiary and submit same to the bank and introduce  you, the bank writes you to confirm this, then transfer process starts without  delays.

I am Mr. Chris Adriaan credit officer of Capitec Bank Ltd.I have a concealed business suggestion for you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Mr. Hassian Hussein who was an Iraqi Business Man and also Deals On Arms With The South African Government made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Nineteen million five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only ($19.5m) in my branch. Upon maturity several notices were sent to him, even during the war, again after the war several notifications were sent and still no response came from him. We later found out that the Mr. Hassian Hussein and his family had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home in Iraq. After further investigation it was also discovered that Mr. Hassian Hussein did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Nineteen million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration three years the funds will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Hassian Hussein so that you will be able to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE: I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Mr. Hassian Hussein, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate/Administration in your favor for the movement of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the Attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner,in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set  aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my  woman colleague.

FROM: DAVID PEDRO. NO.1023 MATIMA STREET FREE STATE, SOUTH AFRICA TEL: +27.785709710 EMAIL: davpe@myway.com ATTENTION: DIRECTOR /CEO. STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don't know me personally, the purpose of my introduction is that, I am MR.DAVID PEDRO ,the first SON of MR.MASIARA PEDRO, a member of commercial farmers union and leader movement for democratic change (MDC)in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I was furnished with viable information from the International Trade Centre here in Johannesburg and I decided to write to you. Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$17 M(SEVENTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS),in a Security Company, as if he fore saw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and the establishment of the new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came when Zimbabwean President MR.ROBERT MUGABE introduced a new  Land Act which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers. This resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. Infact, a lot of people have been killed  because of this land reformed Act for which my father was one of the victims. It is against this background, that I and my family who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my father's money to foreign account since the law of South Africa prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction. As the eldest SON of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in  South Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future since  both countries have similar political history. Moreover, the South African  Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment as an asylum seeker.  As a business man, whom I have entrusted my future and of my family in his  hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept  to assist me and my family. will aid us in transferring the money into any account you will nominate overseas. This money I intend to use for investment. I have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have a certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into  partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your  country. Which ever the option you want, feel free to notify me as I have  also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the  process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money while the remaining 75% will be for my investment in your country. Contact me with the above telephone number while I  Implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction. And no matter the level of transaction we are, you must call me on phone first before sending a reply. Please, you should keep this transaction secret and confidential. contact  me on this  mail direct  email:davpe@myway.com And send your fax and telephone numbers for easy communication/B.I would like you to furnish me with the following: 1) YOUR PRIVATE PHONE AND FAX NUMBERS. 2) YOUR FULL NAME. 3) YOUR FULL ADDRESS.

One of my valued clients - Mr. Antonio Montoya died together with his lovely wife Late Antonio Montoya died on the Flight 11, a Boeing 767-200, which was enroute to Los Angeles from Boston during the terrorist attack on America back in 2001.   I was his personal lawyer and the Executor of his Will. There are no further traces of any of his next-of-kin in his native Country. As his personal lawyer and Executor of his Will, I know late Antonio Montoya kept about GBP 9.2 million in the Vaults of a bank here in London.  This money had been taken to the bank late on the evening of his departure to USA; hence the money was only accepted and registered by the bank while it was kept in the Vault waiting for Montoya's return, which was never to be.   I have since confirmed with the bank that the money is still in the bank's vault. Ever since 2001 this money has been in this account untouched!    Now, how do you come in and what is your business with all this?  I am sure this is the question you would be asking me?   Simple, As the personal lawyer to late Antonio Montoya and since vital document relating to this money is kept with my Chambers, I decided that I intimate you of this development, with your co-operation, I can present you to bank as the Next-of-Kin to the late Antonio Montoya.   After proper verification of this Claim by the bank this money will be transferred to your bank account hence you come in as the Next-of-Kin to late Antonio Montoya. How do we do it?  The document showing that this money is kept in the bank's vault is kept in my Law Chambers.   I, as the lawyer and Executor of late Antonio Montoya's Will/Last Testament will put your name in this Will as the Beneficiary of this money kept in the bank's vault.   I will submit the Will/Last Testament to the Bank to contact you and start processing transfer of this money to your bank account according to the last wishes of my Client - late Mr. Montoya for further administration to other members of the family.   I am the Executor of late Montoya's Will. All I need to do is to re-make the late Mr. Montoya's Will/Last Testament to include your name as the beneficiary and submit same to the bank and introduce you, the bank writes you to confirm this, then transfer process starts without delays.  I am the Executor of this Will and the Bank knows it too. The mode of sharing this money will be discussed when we agree to work together on this transaction. What do you think about this?  While I look forward to hearing from you soon, absolute confidentiality and secrecy remain very important in this transaction.   Thank you and God bless you.      Barrister Gareth Jones.

After series of prayers/fasting.i was divinely directed to contact you among other names found in the data base Yahoo tourist search.I believe that God has a way of helping who is in need.    I am (Ben Coroma),the Head of file Department in African development bank (ADB). In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died along side with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don’t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after eight years, the money will be transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10% will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60% would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.  Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

I am MR ALBERT SITHOLI, the Bank Manager of Amalgamated Bank of South Africa {ABSA}. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. An American Gold Consultant/Contractor with the South African Solid Gold Corporation, Mr. Glenn Hatleberg made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$20,000,000.00 (Twenty Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South African Solid Gold Corporation that Glenn Hatleberg died in a plane crash in Alaska Airlines Flight #261 (for more information about this crash and person, you can contact this website: http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/ Since we got this information about his death on further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of Kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Glenn Hatleberg did not declare any Kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Republic of South Africa, at the expiration of 6 (SIX) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Glenn Hatleberg so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of Kin. We shall employ the services of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of Probate/Administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the Beneficiary/next of Kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you, then 10% will be mapped out for any expenses that we may incur during transactions. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private Fax and Phone numbers below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. And kindly observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

PHONE+27 73 130 8560                                        STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Sir/Madam, You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally. I am Mr. Mazuri Martins the first son of Mr.Philip Mazuri, who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe .I got your contact through the internet network online hence I decided to write you. Before the death of my father, he travelled to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$ 25.5Million (Twenty Five  Million Five  Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) only, in one of the private security/finance companies, as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe.  This money was deposited in the security / finance company as family valuables and consignment to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines/ farm machineries and chemicals for the farms and establishment of a new farm   in Swaziland because he is the chairman of the farmers association while Mum was the treasurer. This land problem came ( and is still on )  when our President Mr. Robert  Mugabe introduced a new Land Act reform which wholly affected the rich white farmers  and some few black  farmers. This resulted to the killing and mob action by the Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society hijacked the opportunity.  In fact, lot of people were killed because of this land reformed Act for which my father was one of the victims, the news about the crisis in Zimbabwe is every where both in the CNN and BBC. It is against this background that, I and my family  who are currently staying in South Africa now decided to transfer my father�s money to a foreign country since the law of South Africa prohibits refugees(political asylum seekers)  to open any bank  account or to be involved in any financial  transaction throughout the  territorial zones of South Africa.  As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign partner with a good bank account where this money could be transferred into without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything. All I seek for is your seriousness, for I am entrusting my future and that of my family into your hands .I must also let you know that this transaction is 100%risk free.  If you accept to assist my family and me all I want from you is for you to make arrangements and come to Johannesburg � South Africa (if possible), so that you can help me   open a non-resident account in your name which will aid us in   transferring the money into any account you will nominate outside South Africa . This money I intend to use for investment in a good business venture. I have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction, or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable business investment of the money in your country. Whichever option you want, feel free to notify me. I will also map out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses we might incur in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money while the remaining 75% will remain for me and my family. If you are really capable and willing to assist me please contact me immediately with my alternative e-mail address above for faster communication. Finally, please give this matter the urgent attention it deserves as I am in dire need to leave this country. Kindly send me your private phone and fax number for easy communication.

Waghorn.', "Request to do business with you Dear Sir,  Naturally this letter will come to you as a surprise since we do not know  each other, please permit me however to introduce myself. I am Didan Kimati, a staff of the Ministry of Finance and Economic planning here in Ghana. At the risk of boasting, I wish you to understand that I am a top personal aid to the Minister and therefore, I am privy to several pieces of information.  This aside, I am the secretary to the Contract payment committee. Subsequent upon the recent debt relief granted by the G8 Nations to the Republic of Ghana, the Government under the leadership of his Excellency, President John A. Kufour, has decided to pay off all the accumulated back-log of contract debts owed to both local and foreign contractors.  However, some of these contract debts span from the regime of his  excellency, Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah down to the PNDC government of Flt. Lt. John J. Rawlings and to his NDC government days even to the first tenure of President Kufour. To this effect, some of the contractors can no longer be traced as they have tried severally to receive their payment success. Obviously, some may have died.  The proposal:  I wish to implore you to come in as our partner to claim the sum of $745   Million United States Dollars which is payment due some contractors who  built the Akosombo Hydro-electric dam. The contract was divided in 3 phases. The civil contractors, the water engineers and the electrical engineering companies. I understand that you may not know anything about this subject and you may not even be conversant with the procedure for building a dam. But do not worry as we have covered all the bases.  All we need to do is apply for an initial payment of $475 Million United   States Dollars for the first phase of the contract. As soon as this is  successfully transferred to your account, we will apply for the other  balance. You do not need to worry about the original contractors.  This has already been taken care of. We removed some of the files when we took them for review. All we have to do is replace them with your company details. As soon as this is done, we shall approve your file for immediate  payment. Once again, do not worry about this, it will be approved.  At this juncture, I wish to point out that the funds are currently deposited  at the Swiss National Bank and I am currently in Geneva where I have held series of meetings with the bank officials at the Swiss National Bank who have assured me that once the neccessary documentation are in place the funds will be directly wired to the designated account. Of course we will give them something for their troubles. While I am here you may reach me on telephone number 0041225330355  We have estimated that it will take between 10 and 14 working days to  complete this project. Should you wish to participate, please contact me.   You may be worried about the legitimacy of this, you may also be worried  about if it were found out. The answer is do not worry, everything has been carefully thought out and planned. Should you have any questions of whatever nature, please do not hesitate to ask me. By the way, you may be worried as well, that this is a scam. There is no need for you to worry. We do sincerely hope to work this out with you.  As regards what's in it for you, we propose a sharing ratio of 60:40. 60%   for us and 40% for you.

PHONE+27 78 7634400 ATTN:MD/C.E.O,   Kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail to you. Although we never met before, I have every reason to believe that you are a highly respected personality, considering the fact that I sourced your profile from a human resource profile database on your country.Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile political situation in Liberia but it has formed consistent headlines in the CNN, BBC news bulletins, My name is Mr.Morgan Yormie Wimpoe , from Liberia, a Country in West Africa. My Father Mr John  Yormie  Wimpoe  former DEPUTY MINISTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY in LIBERIA. My  Father  was falsely accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA (CHARLES TAYLOR) from office. Without trial, Charles Taylor killed him. you can verify this from these international newspaper website below:   (i) http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-07-15-liberia_x.htm   Before he was killed, my Father instructed me to escape with my family to a hide out in JOHANNESBOURG, SOUTH AFRICA, and he confided in me that he left some money in a Diplomatic Trust Company in Abroad, (name withheld for security reasons) . All i require from you is to assist me in claiming the fund (sealed in diplomatic consignment) from security company and invest in your country. When you claim the fund, i shall come over to your country with my Family so that we can start a new life If you may ask why do I need a foreign assistance  or why can't i take the cash transfer by  myself? The answer is that there  was an exclusion clause in the original agreement between the company and my father  which states unambiguously that 'nobody, not even himself, can have access to the consignment in the company, and it has to be transferred to a foreign beneficiary outside Africa. This was done because he  envisaged his arrest and this clause were inserted to prevent any seizure or infiltration of the fund.   My decision to contact you is therefore, informed by this and due to my present social status and total ignorance of the business world. I believe you will appreciate the enormity of trust I repose on you by placing the fortunes of our family in your care. Permit me to request that you should reassure me that you would not let me down in any way.   On my part, this is my assurance and guarantee to you.In as much as you follow my instructions carefully, religiously and promptly my guarantee of a hitch-free success remains unshakable. I have contacted the Diplomatic Security Firm to confirm the deposit, which is worth $32,Million,(Thirty two million United State Dollars Only). You will be given 20% of the total sum at the end of the transaction. If you will be willing to assist us claim the money and invest it in your country. I want to assure you that all modalities are in place and it is a risk free transaction.   Kindly include your Full names, Private Telephone and Fax numbers where you can always be reach, Your Residential or Company Address to enable me send some other important information across to you.

BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) OUAGADOUGOU,BURKINA FASO Dear, I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foriegn remittance department  of Bank Of Africa (B.O.A). In my department we discovered an abandoned sum  of US$15.5 (fiftteen million five hundred thousand US dolloars) in an account that  belongs to one of our foriegn customer who died along with his entire family in a  plane crash that happened in Kenya, East Africa. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next  of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that  all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the  plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. Please I want you to visit the website below for more information about the  Plane Crash and the Deceased DR. GEORGE W. BRUMLEY AND HIS  FAMILY: http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/20/kenya.crash/index.html It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is  coming for it and I don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as  unclaimed bill. I agree that 40% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in  respect to the provision of a foriegn account, and 60% would be for me,  There after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the  percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as  arranged,youmust apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the  deceasedindicatingyour bank name, your bank account number, your private  telephone andfax number for easy and effective communication and location  wherein the money will beremitted.Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application to fill and  send to the bank. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this  transaction is 100% Risk free and you should keep this transaction top secret. I know what to do and move the fund into your account without any delay and  that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements  have been made for the transfer. You should contact me as soon as you receive this letter . Yours faithfully. Mr  kanazoe alidaa.

My name is  Mr Adams   Swll.   I am the bill and exchange manager in African Development Bank. I hope that you will not expose or betray this trust and confidence that I am about to repose on you for the mutual benefit of our both families. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of our Bank who perished along with his next of kin with Korean Air Line, flight number 801 with the whole passengers on 6th of august 1997 and for your perusal you can view this site  http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/guam.passenger.list Since the demise of this our customer, I personally have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of US$11.3M (Eleven Million Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which has been with our branch for a very long time. On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the Next of Kin since nobody is coming for the fund again. The Banking ethics here do not allow such money to stay more than 10 years, because the money will be  recalled to our Banks treasury as unclaimed fund after this period. In view of this I got your contact through the Internet when I was making a research on a foreigner that I will use in this great opportunity because I don't want the money to be recalled to our Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. I have also agreed to offer 40% of the total sum and the rest 60% will be for me. The reason for a foreigner in the business is for the fact that the deceased man was a foreigner and it is not authorized by the law guiding our Bank for a citizen of this country to make the claim of the fund.So the request for you as a foreigner to come into the business is necessary, it will facilitate the release and transfer of the fund smoothly into your reliable Bank account as the only surviving relation to the deceased. If you are really sure of your integrity, trustworthy and confidentiality, and accept not to cheat or disappoint me after this business, reply with your telephone and fax numbers and Banking account details where you wish to receive the fund. Upon receipt of the above mentioned information, indicating your interest in the business, I will send you by fax or e-mail a letter of application which you will type and send back to our bank to enable us start this transaction. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is risk free and doesn't have any negative implication. You should not entertain any fear as all modalities for the smooth and easy transfer of this fund have been finalized. This transaction will be completed within 14 bank working days immediately we start the business. Waiting for your urgent response and please kindly delete if you are not interested.

This mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignore it as unserious could come into your mind; but please consider it a divine wish and accept it with a deep sense of humility. I am Mr. Peter Wong director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have a obscured business suggestion for you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Basem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home. After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that you will be able to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE: I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favour for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavour to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.

This might be a surprise to you about where I got your contact address, I got your address from the South African Network Online {SAINO} when I was desperately looking for a trust-worthy person to assist my son who is currently residing in South Africa, and so I decided to contact you. During the current war against the farmers in Zimbabwe from the supporters of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white-owned farms to his party members and his followers, he ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms to his party members. My husband was one of the best farmers in our country and because he did not support Mugabe�s ideas, Mugabe�s supports invaded my husband farm and burnt everything in the farm, killing my husband and made away with a lot of items in my husband farm. Before his death, my husband had deposited with one of the Security Company in Johannesburg, South Africa the sum of (20Million  United States Dollars).
