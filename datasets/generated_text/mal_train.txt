["PRIVATE EMAIL MESSAGE Good Day, With warm heart I offer my friendship, and send my best wishes in this special season. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you, as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I also sincerely seek your confidence, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity. First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email.  My Uncle(Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this struggle interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of direction. I now desire a peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to seek!  political asylum. I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited for sometime now for security reasons, and have now deicded to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit.  President Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the here. I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy. Your role in this project, is clearing the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here.  For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money.  I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the consignment containing the funds, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response. I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal.  Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.

Good Day, With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity. First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. I also crave your indulgence to read this carefully, and have a general overview of my situation.  My Uncle (Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership.

As I already lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holla! nd) to seek for political asylum. I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the Security Company here in Amsterdam.  President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here. I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy. Your role in this project, is acting on my behalf to clear the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here.  For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money.  I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the safety deposit, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response. I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal.  Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me.

Good Day, With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity. First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. I also crave your indulgence to read this carefully, and have a general overview of my situation.  My Uncle (Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holla! nd) to seek for political asylum. I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the Security Company here in Amsterdam.  President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here. I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy. Your role in this project, is acting on my behalf to clear the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here.  For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money.  I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the safety deposit, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response. I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal.  Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me.

Two years ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in the Ministry of  Energy and Mineral Resources by my committee. This contract was over  invoiced to the tune of US$14.3Million. This was done delibrately. The over  invoicing was a deal by my commitee to benefit from the project. We now  desire to transfer this money which is in a suspense account with the MEMR  into any oversea account which we expect you to provide for us.   For providing the account where we shall remit the money, you will be  entitled to 30% of the money, 10%  will be set aside for expenses incurred  by both parties during course of transfer, while the remaining 60%will be  for my partners and myself.

We have strong and reliable connections, top government  contacts at the South Africa Reserve Bank and Ministry of Finance and we  have no doubt that all this money will be released and transferred if we get  the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal. Therefore, when the  business is successfully concluded we shall through our connection withdraw  all documents used from all the concerned Government Ministries for 100%  security.

Mob 234 80 33097776.  Sir,  I am making this contact to you on the fact that we may be of assistance to each other in  developing a long lasting cordial business relationship. I was moved by the recommendations made  of your sincerity to handle a business relationship that involves huge money on trust. I was  constrained by the sudden death of my husband, the former Minister of Power and steel and  currently before his death, the Minister for Justice of my country, whom was assassinated by an  unknown men.  I am Mrs. Amina Ige, the second wife of the late Mr. Bola Ige who died on December 23rd 2001.  With heart full of grief, I regret to inform you of the inhumane and harsh conditions which my  husband's first wife and the brother's have subjected me and my only son, Mr.Ahmed J. Bola Ige  (Jr.).Since my husband's death, the relatives have been wicked to us because of the following  reasons:  1. I am not from the same tribe with them.  2. My refusal to learn and speak their tribal language and dress like other women from their tribe.  3. My refusal to accept their religion  4. Because I have only one child, a male child.  5. Because I was specially loved and favored by my late husband.  I am absolutely tired of all these threats from my husband’s relatives since the death of my  husband. I am no longer in their Family house. I am now in my husband's guesthouse, with my Son,  I seriously need your kind assistance and co-operations.  Few weeks before my husband's death,  he entrusted the cash sum of $85 million U.S dollars to my care for safe keeping in my apartment.  After his death I acted fast to deposit in a private security company vault to avoid my husband's  relations getting to see it in the house. This sum is secretly concealed in boxes.  Now I solicit your assistance to accept this sum for self-keeping. This I cannot lodge into a  local bank account to avoid suspicion from the Government, my husband's brother's and wife  since they have Confiscated all that is left by my husband and still places eyes on me if they  could lay hands on more including cash as they have left me and my child without any cash. If you  can accept this, I urge you to contact us immediately for us to brief you on arrangement on how  we can possibly handle this.

I came to know of your name and address in my search for a reliable and low-key person to handle a very confidential transaction based on unflinching trust as we have not met before. This transaction involves  the transfer of huge sum of foreign exchange (the United States Dollars) to a foreign account. There were a series of contracts executed by a Consortium  of Multinationals in the oil industry in favour of NNPC among   which are:  (1) The expansion and rehabilitation of the ageing pipeline network within Nigeria for crude oil and downstream products distribution and evacuation - US$9 Billion;  (2) Contracts for the Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) of the four epileptic refineries in the country;  (3) The construction of more storage tanks and maintenance and servicing of old ones for Petroleum Products Storage  (Depots) - US$90 Million;  (4) The construction of Escravos Gas Poduction Offshore facility.  The original value of these contracts was deliberately over-invoiced in  the sum of USD   Eighteen Million,Five Hundred Thousand ($18,500,000.00) by this committee (CRPAC) during the awards of the various contract. This sum ($18,500,000.00) has now been approved for payment by this committee (CRPAC)and is now ready to be transfered by the Central Bank of Nigeria to the account of any individual and or company which the CRPAC presents as the beneficiary, since the company that actually executed these contracts has been fully paid their fund and the projects have been officialy commissioned. Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement on our behalf, since we as civil servants and we are also serving in a sensitive foreign payment approval committee (CRPAC) are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening or operating foreign account and or dealing in foreign exchange in our names. Needless to say!   , the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed to offer you 25% of the transferred  sum, while 10% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) accrued between the parties in the course of the transaction.  You must however note that this transaction is subject to the following terms and conditions:  a) Our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence;  b) That you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality;  c) That you have an unflincing trust in us, and our ability to complete all official processes with your co-operation;  (d) That the funds would be transfered to an ordinary account which you have total control over.  Modalities have been worked out at the highest levels of the relevant government departments involved and the Central Bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of funds within 14 working days subject to your  satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance is that your role is risk-free. To accord this transaction the legality it  deserves and for mutual security of the fund, the whole approvalprocedures will be officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary, as in an ideal situation.It is imperative that you bear in mind that having put in 19 years in the service of the government, I am averse to having  my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency.  Kindly expedite action by contacting me on my e-mail address, indicating your interest in this transaction. For swift response to your reply,kindly indicate your fax and telephone numbers clearly so that I can explain further, especially by fax. I am urgently waiting your reply as payment to foreign contractors is usually made on quarterly basis.  Yours faithfully,  Mr.Kola Daniel. ', 'URGENT APPEAL FOR HELP. From: J.Rodney chesson jr  Chesson Family Corporation,  Liberia.  email: chesson_joseph@yahoo.com Kindest attention, I am very sorry for the informal manner in which this mail is reaching you. This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trustworthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence and pray that you take my request very serious.I am Mr. Joseph Rodney Chesson, the first son of Late J. J. F. Chesson (Liberian Minister of Justice 1979 to 1980). On April 22, 1980, my father along with 12 other Liberian Government officials was assassinated as a result of a military coup that toppled the government of President William R. Tolbert, Jr. May his soul rest in Eternal Peace. Since then, my family has always been seen as a symbol of peace in Liberia. You can view our family web page below;  (http://www.chessonfamily.com/chessonfamilypage.htm) but please do not call me  on the tel/fax number below as the number is presumed bugged by the government. I received information from a reliable source that described your country as being economically conducive for investment and her people as transparent and trustworthy to engaging business, which made me to write you. As you may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your email address from an Internet site that portrayed you in good light.  Early this year, Liberia rebels agitated for the removal of President Charles Taylor, who portrayed a very good example of a bad leader. The President who needed support from prominent Liberia citizen gave me the sum of twenty-eight million United States Dollars (US$ 28M) cash (stalked in two trunk boxes) as compensation for my late father and solicited for my support. I quickly made an arrangement with a courier company here in Monrovia and moved the consignment to an asset management company in  the uk. I did not support President Charles Taylor because my conscience is not for sale. Some months later heavy fight broke up in Liberia, he placed all the eligible members of my family under travel watch,confiscated all our traveling documents and frozen all our account in Liberia. Later in July, foreign troops invaded Liberia and different peace keeping meetings were held and President Taylor was advised to step down for national peace. On the 11th August 2003 President Charles Taylor flied into exile but the problem we are having now is that he handed over power to his Vice-President Moses Blah who is more wicked and dangerous. He was the person that instigated Taylor to confiscated all our traveling documents and frozen all our account in Liberia. That is why I requested for your sincere assistance pending when a fresh election will be held here. The main rebel faction Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) has vowed to continue its war if Taylor hands over to Blah. The rebels are not happy with the above development so they still continued fighting.  WHAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO DO FOR US:I will transfer the ownership of the consignment /boxes containing the cash to you and issue you a power of attorney through my Lawyer. With these document you will lay claims to the money as my proxy from the company in europe. The entire operation is risk free since it is only you and me and my Lawyer that knows the details of the money after you must have taken the money to your country where it is save my lawyer will then meet you in your country to use my share of the money for investment. Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, I propose a commission of 20% (twenty percent) of the total sum to you for the expected services and assistance. Your private fax and telephone numbers are needed to enhance the speedy conclusion of this transaction (our only hope in life now) urgently. Your urgent response via the above email address is highly needed so as to stop further contact. I must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily confidential whatever your decision while I await your prompt response. Our phone line both home and abroad are bugged. So don�t call me. I will always call you at my convenient time and in a conducive atmosphere.

Consequently, my son -Mohammed Abacha who has been under torture in detention for a sin he did not commit and made to make a lot of  confessions as regards valuables, money inclusive that my late husband  entrusted in his hand for safe-keeping has been released and presently being under security watch.  The latest is his confession on the US$700,000,000.00 (Seven Hundred  Million United States Dollars) cash his late father gave him for safe keeping.

Presently, l can not travel out of Nigeria, because,if you have gone  through the above  mentioned website address, you will see how My son´s confession have  implicated my husband and infact the whole of my family.

My problem now is, l want someone that can assist me to move the  US$30,000,000.000  (Thirty Million United States Dollars) out from the Security Company,  before Mohammed will open up to the Security Agents. To this regard l am soliciting for your assistance to claim the boxes containing the money from the Security Company and move the money to your country.  I shall be ready to negotiate with you any percentage you might want  from the sum.  On your advise l shall be ready to invest my own share of the sum in your country.

This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence and pray that you take my request very serious. I am Mr. J. Rodney Chesson, the first son of Late J. J. F. Chesson (Liberian Minister of Justice 1979 to 1980). On April 22, 1980, my father along with 12 other Liberian Government officials was assassinated as a result of a military coup that toppled the government of President William R. Tolbert, Jr. May his soul rest in Eternal Peace. Since then, my family has always been seen as a symbol of peace in Liberia.  I received information from a reliable source that described your country as being economically conducive for investment and her people as transparent and trustworthy to engaging business, which made me to write you. As you may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your email address from an Internet site that portrayed you in good light. Early this year, Liberia rebels agitated for the removal of President Charles Taylor, who portrayed a very good example of a bad leader. The President who needed support from prominent Liberia citizen gave me the sum of twenty-eight million United States Dollars (US$ 28M) cash (stalked in two trunk boxes) as compensation for my late father and solicited for my support.  I quickly made an arrangement with a courier company here in Monrovia and moved the consignment to an asset management company in Europe. I did not support President Charles Taylor because my conscience is not for sale. Some months later heavy fight broke up in Liberia, he placed all the eligible members of my family under travel watch confiscated all our traveling documents and frozen all our account in Liberia. Later in July, foreign troops invaded Liberia and different peace keeping meetings were held and President Taylor was advised to step down for national peace. On the 11th August 2003 President Charles Taylor flied into exile and handed over power to his Vice-President Moses Blah who is even more wicked and dangerous. He was the person that instigated Taylor to confiscated all our traveling documents and frozen all our account in Liberia. On Tuesday 14th October 2003, Gyude Bryant took office in Liberia as the head of an interim government. Bryant, 54 was by picked b!  y the warring factions and this step has offered Liberia a new chance to end nearly 14 years of violence. My lawyer approached him as regards releasing our traveling documents and the embargo on our bank accounts but he declined and told us that his priority is disarm fighters and pave the way for elections that is why I requested for your sincere assistance pending when a fresh election will be held here.  WHAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO DO FOR US:  I will transfer the ownership of the consignment /boxes containing the cash to you and issue you a power of attorney through my Lawyer. With these document you will claims to the money as my proxy from the asset management company in Europe. The entire operation is risk free since it is only you and me and my Lawyer that knows the details of the money after you must have taken the money to your country where it is save my lawyer will then meet you in your country to use my share of the money for investment. Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, I propose a commission of 20% (twenty percent) of the total sum to you for the expected services and assistance. Your private fax and telephone numbers are needed to enhance the speedy conclusion of this transaction (our only hope in life now) urgently. Your urgent response via the above email address is highly needed so as to stop further contact. I must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily confidential whatever your decision while I await your prompt response. Our phone line both home and abroad are bugged. So don't call me. I will always call you at my convenient time and in a conducive atmosphere. Best regards, J. Rodney Chesson. N.B.

HOW THE MONEY CAME ABOUT:  There is an account opened in this bank in 1980 and since  1990 nobody has operated on this account again,after going  through some old files in the records I discovered that if  I do not remitte this money out urgently it will be  forfeited for nothing.The owner of this account is Mr. Jack  Hamilton, he is a foreigner and the manager of of petrol  chemical service,a chemical Engineer by proffession and he  died  since 1990, and since then no other person knows  about this account or anything concerning it.secondly he  did not clearify his next of kin in his deposition form  when he deposited this fund in our bank.The account has no  other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well  that his company does not know anything about this account  and the amount involved is (U.S.$ 26,000,000.00).  I want to tranfer this money into a safe foreign account  abroad but i don't know any foreigner,I am contacting you  as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to  any local bank here but can only be approved to a foreign  account because the money is in u.s dollars and the former  owner of the account (MR.JACK HAMILTON) is a foreigner too.

I am contacting you because of the need to involve a  foreigner with a  foreign account as the real beneficiary,I need your  co-operation to makethis work fine,because the management  of our bank is ready to approve this payment to any  foreigner who has the correct information to this account  which i will give to you when sure of your capability to  handle such amount with instrict confidence and trust,and  according to my instructions and my advice for our mutual  benefit because I don't want to make any mistake.

I am also a member of its Foreign  Contract Tenders Committee (FCTC). My principal Job/function  has to do with the Appraisal and Approval of payment of contract  awarded by this parastatal. In the course of my duties, I discovered  various over inflated contract values totaling US$32.5Million. The  said amount emanated from deliberate over invoicing of old  projects executed by some foreign firms through some government  officials.These officials have since been moved or retired following  the inauguration of the new administration. After due consultation  with key members of the Tenders Committee (FCTC), I was mandated to  seek and arrange with a trusted foreign National who can assist us in  transferring the above state amount out of Nigeria.  Now that all the contracts have been paid following the completion  and commissioning of the various contract, the above mentioned sum  through approved is still floating. We decided to transfer this money  to a safe and trusted bank accounts with a very reliable person to  assist us after which the funds be share in the understated ratio.  Your assistance is needed for two main reasons; (i) As government  employees ,we are not permitted by the Nigeria law to operate  foreignaccounts. (ii)Since the initial contracts were executed by the  foreign firms, only a foreign firm can make claims or as a  beneficiary for the purpose of transferring the money out of Nigeria.  We have unanimously agreed to compensate you with 35% of the total  sum ( US$32.5Million ) if you are willing to render us your  assistance as regards the transfer .it was also agreed that 5% shall  be set aside to offset incidental expenses that might be incurred by  either of us course of offsetting this transfer. The remaining 60%  shall be our due share.  All necessary arrangements required for a speedy conclusion of this  transaction have been put in place with top officials of the Nigeria  Federal Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria to enable  us conclude the whole transaction within a very shortspace of time.  What is required of you is first to furnish us with the following  through my email address.  1.) Bank details to be used (that is banks name and account number )  2.) The beneficiary's name.  3.) Your private / official telephone and fax number.  While promising you a smooth and hitch -free transfer of this fund  into the account nominated by you, we want you to know that this is  very sensitive transaction which should not be disclosed to any other  party.

SUSAN  SHABANGU SOUTH AFRICA {MY CONTACT PRIVATE EMAIL {susanshabangu00@netscape.net} {MY SON CONTACT NUMBER+27-73-323-0163}  Dear Sir, First, let me start by introducing myself as MRS SUSAN SHABANGU,a mother of three children and the Deputy Minister of Safety and Security since 29th  April 1996 to date under the auspices of the President of South Africa MR THABO MBEKI. After due deliberation with my children, I decided to contact you for your assistance in standing as a beneficiary to the sum of US$30.5M ( Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) You can view my profile at my website www.gov.za  click on, Contact Information, then click on Deputy Minister, and finally, click on Safety and Security  and read about me. THE PROPOSAL, After the swearing in ceremony making me the Deputy Minister of Safety and Security, my husband Mr.  Ndelebe  Shabangu died while he was on an official trip to Trinidad and Tobago in 1996. After his death, I discovered that he had some funds in a dollar account which amounted to the sum of US$30.5M with a security and finance institution in South Africa  of which I will divulge information to you when I get your full consent and support to go for a change of beneficiary and subsequent transfer of the funds into you a comfortable and conducive account of your choice.  This fund emanated as a result of an over-invoiced contract  which he executed with the Government of South Africa. Though I assisted him in getting this contract but I never knew that it was over-invoiced by him. I am afraid that the government of South Africa might start to investigate on contracts awarded from 1990 to date. If they discover this money in his bank account, they will confiscate it and seize his assets here in South Africa and this will definitely affect my political career in government. I want your assistance in opening an account with bankers through my banker so that this fund could be wired into your account directly without any hitch. As soon as the fund gets to your account, you are expected to move it immediately into another personal bank account in your country.  I will see to it that the account is not traced from South Africa. As soon as you have confirmed the fund into your account, I will send my eldest son with my Attorney to come to your country to discuss on business investments. For your assistance, I am offering you 20% of the principal sum which amounts to US$6,100.000.00 (Six million One Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only)And 5% will be for Any expenses that both of us may Incure in this transaction. And another 5%will go for Motherless babes home. However, you have to assure me and also be ready to go into agreement with me that you will not elope with my fund.

With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings,and I hope this mail meets you in good time.I have mused over your profile for sometime and decided to contact you in this regard. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you, as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past,I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I also sincerely seek your confidence, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.  First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Mr.Robert Savimbi,I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email.  My Uncle(Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death,Mr. Antonio Dembo and general Paulo Lukamba who were his second in commands, assumed office as leaders of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo and general lukamba,  there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose them and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension  and confusion in UNITA became uncontrollable when Mr.Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this struggle interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of direction. I now  desire a peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to seek political asylum.  I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (Eighteen Million Dollars Only), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank  account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam,Netherlands. in February when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited  for sometime now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to the netherlands to sought for political asylum here is because of the safe deposit.  President Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the here.  I plan to use this money to safeguard my families future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.  Your role in this project, is clearing the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name from the Security and finance company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here.  For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with Fifteen Percent of the Money of the money.  I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the consignment containing the funds, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.  I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal.  Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.

DEAR SIR/MADAM  This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the  fact that we have not met.The message could be strange  but real if you pay some attention to it. Please  accept my sincere apologies.In bringing this message  of goodwill to you, I have to say that I have no  intention of causing you any pains.  My name is SENATOR VICTOR OYOFO,representing Edo North  FederalConstituency,(<http://www.nigeria.gov.ng/government/Nationalass.htm).member>, Pension Funds Committee in the senate of the Federal Republic Of Nigeria. I am writing you to earnestly Solicit your assistance in helping to  receive some sum of money. I got your e-mail address  on the Internet while searching for a reliable and  reputable person to handle this transaction.  THE PROPOSITION: We have the sum of US$25,200,000.00  (Twenty Five Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars)  that we intend to transfer overseas through the  assistance of a foreign partner.This money came as a  result of the unclaimed pension funds belonging to a  British expatriate petroleum engineer with the  Nigerian National Gas Company,Engr.John Bruno. After  all other pensioners have been paid their  entitlements, we deposited this unclaimed sum of  US$25,200,000.00,with the Debt Management Committee.  In a bid to make sure Engr.John Bruno gets his due,I  sent a routine notification to his forwarding address  but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder  and finally we discovered from his contract employers,  the Nigerian Gas Company that Engr.John Bruno died,  from an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died  without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his  next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further  investigation and discovered that Engr.John Bruno did  not declare any kin or relations in all his official  documents. This sum of US$25,200,000.00 is still  sitting in an account of the Debt Management Committee  and the interest is being rolled over with the  principal sum at the end of each year.No one will ever  come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law,at  the expiration of 2 (two) years,the money will revert  to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody  applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal  is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as  the next of kin to Engr.John Bruno so that the fruits  of this old man's labour will not get into the hands  of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately  your full names,address,telephone and fax numbers so  that I can prepare the necessary documents and  affidavits that will put you in place as the next of  kin to Engr Bruno. Upon this,we would then obtain the  letter of probate/administration in your favor from a  Federal High Court.A bank account in any part of the  world that you will provide will then facilitate the  transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next  of kin. The money will be paid into your account for  us to share in the ratio of 65% for me and my  partners,30% for you and 5% for any expences  incured,during the course of this transaction.  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this  transaction will be done at the high court and my  position as a member of the Committee guarantees the  successful execution of this transaction.The fund  shall be transferred to you legally in accordance to  all laid down procedures governing transfer of funds.  If you are interested, please reply immediately via my  email address. Upon your response, I shall then  provide you with more details and relevant documents  that will help you understand the transaction.Please  observe utmost confidentiality,and rest assured that  this transaction would be most profitable for both of  us because I shall require your assistance to invest  my share in your country.  Awaiting your urgent reply via my email address.  Thanks and regards,  Sen.Victor Oyofo.

Dear friend,  I MAKE THIS APPEAL WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ANY  FACTS OR OPINION EXPRESSED BY ME ARE GIVING IN  CONFIDENCE AND SOLELY FOR YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION  AND USE.  I am MR. Thomas Sarr, the manager of bill and exchange  at the foreign remittance department of my  Bank. In  my department I discovered an abandoned sum of  US$8.5m,(Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand US  Dollars) with account number 14-2558-5976 that belongs  to one of our  foreign customers who died along with  his wife and only daughter in a plane  crash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261 which  crashed on 31 January, 2000. You shall read more about  the crash on visiting this site  http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/  The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an  American and great industrialist and a resident of  Alaska.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided  to make this business proposal to you and for our bank  to release the money to you. You have to follow the  instructions which I will send to you as the next of  kin or relation to the deceased for safety and  subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it  and I don't want this money to go into  our bank treasury as  unclaimed  bill.  The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if  such money remained unclaimed after three years, the  money will be transfered into the bank treasury as  unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than  three years and I am preparing documentations to prove  that this money has been transfered to our bank  treasury. It will be between me and you only that will  know that the money is not transfered into our  treasury. The request of foreigner as next of kin in  this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the  customer was a foreigner and a Senegalese cannot stand  as next of kin to a foreigner.  In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering you  30% of the total sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of  transfer/other charges) likely to  be incurred during  the course of transaction, while the remaining 65%  is  for me.  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax  or email the text of the application which you will  complete and forward to our bank asking for this money  to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. Morris  Thomson. I will not fail to bring to your notice that  this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not  entertain any fear as all required arrangements have  been made for the transfer. You should contact me  immediately as soon as you receive this mail through  the above email.  PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY.  PLEASE DO CONSIDER MY REQUEST AS URGENT.  You may contact me also at sarrthom1@lycos.com.  Yours  Faithfully,  Thomas SARR ", 'Ciali$. Only 3 usd per dose! Alrite :)  Adolphus', 'regards! Hello,  I am Patrick Camara.

For i know this may seem like a complete intrusion to your privacy but right about now this is my option of communication. This note might seem strange or probably untrue considering the amount of junk mails we receive daily, but i believe this is still the most genuine way of contacting a true character.  I will introduce myself as the Head of Foreign Operations Department in the accounts management section this well-known bank here in the United Kingdom as Stated above. I am seeking your cooperation to present you to my bank as the Next of kin to LATE ANDREA SCHRANNER. A Germany property Magnate Andreas Schranner, 64, his wife Maria, 62, their daughter Andrea Eich, 38, her husband Christian, 57, and their children Katharina, eight, and Maximilian, 10, all perished in the jet. Please click here below for verification.  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm PROPOSITION: One of late Andrea Schranner's accounts with holding balance of £15,000,000(Fifteen Million British Pounds) has been dormant and has not been operated for the past 5 years and the DEPOSIT will be converted to UNCLAIMED  DEPOSIT and therefore forfeited if nobody comes forward to lay claim to the deposit before the end of this financial quarter, as is the practice and also indicated in the EU banking guidelines. >From my investigations and confirmation, the owner of this account a foreigner by name Late Andrea Schranner's died on MONDAY, 31 JULY,2000 in a plane crash with his family. After going through the deceased records and files, I discovered that:  (1) No one has operated this account since 2000; (2) He died without a heir; hence the money has been floating.  (3) No other person knows about this account and there was no known beneficiary.  And if we do not remit this money urgently, it would be confiscated and forfeited for nothing. I have secretly discussed this matter with account officer and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. We thus propose to do business with you, standing in as the next of kin of these funds from the deceased and funds released to you after due processes have been followed.  This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is a legitimate and does not originate from drug, money laundering, terrorism or any other illegal act.

Dear Sir,  Naturally, this letter will come to you as a surprise since we have not met, permit me however, I am Mr. Alan Jack a Zimbabwean Farmer.  I am contacting you as the need for me to have a foreign partner in your country has become necessary due to my plans to relocate and establish a private company in that region, as the present political instability in my country (Zimbabwe), does not encourage financial investment as the environment is not conducive for investment and most of all security is not guaranteed, just as reported by the International media.  This problem started when the Zimbabwean government under the leadership of President Robert Mugabe announced a decree on May 31st 2001 to seize more than 6000 white-owned farms. So far, more than 5,400 white owned farms have been invaded, properties confiscated and farm lands seized. During these periods, as reported by the international media and C.N.N, more than 500 white farmers were killed; the government didn't stop at this, as just recently the government has asked all white-farmers to give up their farms to black farmers or risk going to prison. Having lived in this country (Zimbabwe) for more than 35 years, I have no other country to go to, nor can I trace any of my distant relatives.  Therefore, I decided to contact you through my local Zimbabwean associate (Mr. Dennis Udongo) for your assistance so that I can establish a company in your country and relocate there. Also, I must re-iterate the importance of having a citizen of your country to front as the owner of the enterprise, due to the fact that I will be a foreigner in your country. For this purpose, I have deposited in a Security Company based in Amsterdam (Holland) all the funds realized from the sales of my farmland and other farming equipment which amounted to USD18, 500,000.00 (Eighteen million, five hundred United States Dollars). These funds was packaged in two metal boxes and declared as personal effects and photographic materials so as to avoid detection by immigration/security officials. For now, I stay in Asia, because Zimbabwe is highly unsafe for me and my family. Upon your immediate response, I will immediately arrange and send to you all the documentation that will empower your good self in finalizing the transaction with the Security Company in UAE Dubai.  Let me use this opportunity to also inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free and genuine and should also be handled in the most confidential manner. This proposal is NOT and must NOT be linked to all the numerous SCAM letters flying around the internet world today. The money (USD18.5m) already stashed in the two boxes could be termed as consignment and I will not hesitate to link you to my safe contact in the security company for further discussion. Lest I forget, you should be entitled to 30% of the total funds for your support and cooperation in the transaction. It’s also your duty to assist me in investing my own share of the money in your company or in your country. I shall be counting on your unalloyed trust and immediate response.  Best Regards and God bless.

My name is Mr. Melvin Samson I work as an accountant in a bank; I contacted  you to work together with me in claiming my late client's estate.  Unfortunately he died without a registered next of kin and as such the funds  now have an open beneficiary status. You could be made the beneficiary since  you share the same last name with him. This has officially transferred the right to you, as no other person from  his family knows anything about this fund with our bank.If you are  interested in working with me, please get back to me as quickly as possible so that I give you the details  of what we are to  do. I wait for your prompt response so that I can give  you more briefing of what you need to and how to do it. Thanks for your co-operation.

Bashir and his party have controlled the government since he led the military coup on 30 June 1989.  The Darfur conflict erupted in early 2003. Fighting among various factions has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced more than 2 million, most escaping to larger towns where they stay in camps for "internally displaced people," and some crossing the border into Chad, where they live in refugee camps, straining local resources. Attacks on civilians during the conflict have been brutal and include burning homes, killing and rape. There has been signed a Darfur Peace Agreement between some of the parties in Darfur. This agreement is supervised by African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS), though the war is still going on. Before the escalation of the war I was a VOLUNTIER SOCIAL WORKER and during my duties one of the local army Commander who was wounded in battle and dying from the wound handed over to me documents showing the sum of Twelve Million United States Dollars (US$12 Million) sent overseas mainly for purchasing foods, pharmaceutical drugs, Clothings etc for millions of Southern Sudanese refugees who have been impoverished, battered and displaced by years of Civil war in our lands.

I would send copy of a POWER OF ATTORNEY given to me by the Late Commander which I would send alongside copies of my INTERNATIONAL PASSPORT and a second Power of Attorney to you that would enable you claim the funds from the Financial Institution upon your agreement and readiness to assist us.  I wish to repeat here and also wish to remind you of the TOP SECRECY this transaction requires, as I expect your positive response through this above Email address as my movement is presently restricted by law covering Political Refugees, though I might give you a telephone number later where you can talk with me. On receiving your positive response we hope to finish this transaction within one week as a lot of our people are dying from sicknesses, diseases and hunger.

I know you will be surprised to read from me, but please this  letter is a request from a family in dire need of assistance. I am Mr.  Mohammed Williams from Angola.The first and the only son of Brigadier Chanza  Williams communicating to you from Johannesburg, South Africa. I got your address from my random search at the net. And, I on behalf of my  widowed mother Mrs. Bridget Williams  decided to solicit for your assistance  to transfer the sum of US$35.8 Million (Thirty five Million Eight Hundred  Thousand United States Dollars), which he deposited in a safe box to private  security company in Johannesburg, South Africa. In fact, my father said, and I quote: �My son, I wish to draw your attention  to US$35.8 Million (Thirty five Million Eight Hundred Thousand United States  Dollars). I deposited the box containing the fund in a security company in  Johannesburg, South Africa as valuables. During the war, I was very  committed and dedicated in winning the war against the rebels, until I found  out that the senior army officers and government functionaries were busy  helping themselves with government funds and properties, sending them to  foreign countries. Due to this, when the former adviser to the president and  I were assigned by the president (JOSE EDUARDO SANTOS) to purchase arms in  South Africa, we saw this as a golden opportunity and diverted the money and  share it, of which I got a total sum of US$35.8 Million (Thirty five Million  Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). In case of my absence on earth as a result of death, only you should solicit  for assistance of a reliable and sincere foreign partner to assist you to  transfer this money out of South Africa for investment purpose. I deposited  the box in your name and you can claim it alone with deposited code. Your  mother is with all the documents. Take good care of your mother and your  sisters. >From these words of my late father, you can understand that life and future  of my family depend on this fund, as such I will be grateful if you can  assist us. We are now living in South Africa as political asylum seekers.  Financial laws and regulations of the Republic of South Africa do not permit  us certain financial rights. In view of this, I cannot invest this fund in  South Africa hence; I am seeking your assistance to transfer this fund out  of South Africa for investment purpose. For your assistance, we are prepared  to offer you 25% of the total fund while 5% will be set aside for any  expenses incurred during this transaction. Please note that this transaction is 100% risk-free and the major thing I  demand from you is to assure me the safety of this money when it finally  gets to you. Further information and arrangement commence as soon as trust  confidence and good relationship are established. I shall be most grateful  if you maintain the confidentiality of this matter. Please, confirm your  interest through the above contact telephone numbers or email.

I am Mrs Janet Bradford, am a widow and an International Oil merchant in Dubai, United Arab Emirate and a member of Project Management Institute. I have been diagnosed with Cancer, which was discovered very late due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all forms of medical attention ; Right now I have only about a few months to live, according to my Medical Consultant from Germany. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for myself but for my the Oil business just because of the fact that am a Widow with no feeling for love and sex from any man since i had lost my lovely husband years ago!. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for since i lost my lovely husband 12 years ago!. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believed when God gives me a second chance and heal me I would livemy life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for my healing and have willed and given most of myproperties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I havedecided to give arms to Charity Organizations and give succor and comfort to the less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I did on earth so far, by distributing some of this money to some Charity Organizations in India. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my selfanymore.I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts in Saudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to Charity Organization and to the less privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan. They cashed the money but kept it only to themselves. Hence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them already. The last of my funds/money, which no one knows of, is the huge cash deposit of Twenty Two Million United States Dollars ( US$ 22 Million) that Ihave in the Vault of The Security Company in Europe as family valuablesince the year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect this deposit on my behalf anddisburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake victims in Asia and for the less privileged. Please sendme a mail to indicate your wiliness to assist in this disbursement. Iwill set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts. I need your urgent reply with the below complete information Your Full names: Your Residential Address: Your phone/Fax numbers: Your Age: Your Occupation: As soon as I receive this from you it will enable me go ahead andinform the company where the said fund is deposited for the project.Be informed that I will make sure I do all I can to ensure that thisproject work out in the name of God .I will also plead to you to always pray for me because only God can heals. I will advice you to also send your reply to my below company email adress. God bless you for your care and understanding.Attached to this email is my present photo in my sick bed, kindly help me along with prayer!!!! Mrs Janet Bradford, Promart Oils and Gas Dubai.
