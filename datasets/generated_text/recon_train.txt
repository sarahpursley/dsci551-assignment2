Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani Abacha the late Former Head of State of Nigeria in 1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness  by the present civilian administration, I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country.  As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many outright blackmail. In fact the total sum discovered by  the Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I will give you more information  as to this regard as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you due to security network placed on my day to day  affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have deposited  the sum of US$35 million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communication. I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safekeeping. This arrangement is known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal directly with you as I am still under house arrest. I am seriously considering to settle down abroad as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start all over again if only you wish, but if it is possible,  just help me in diverting this funds into your bank account which will accrue you 20% of this fund. Please honesty is the watchword in this transaction.

I am Mr George Mboro , a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (US$18,500,000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount (US$18.5m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30% of the US$18.5 million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality.

I want to assure you that myself and my partners are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and Please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter; because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.  I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. I am available to entertain any questions concerning the clarity of this transaction.  Yours faithfully, Mr  George  Mboro', 'URGENT BUSINESS TRUSTEE TRANSFER OF USD$22MILLION INTO YOUR ACCOUNT} ATTENTION: President\\CEO. I, on behalf of my other colleagues from different organs of Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as regards transfer of the above-mentioned amount into your bank account.  This fund accrued from over invoicing of various contract awarded in my parastatal to certain Foreign Contractors sometimes ago. We, as holders of sensitive position in our various parastatals, were mandated by the Federal Government to Scrutinise all payments made to certain foreign Contractors and we discovered that some of the contracts they executed were grossly over-invoiced either by omission or commission.  In the process the sum of US$27M (Twenty Seven Million US Dollars only) was found lying in the parastatal suspense account after the foreign contractors had been paid their rightful dues for executing the said contracts. We all agreed that this over-invoiced amount be transferred (for our own use) into a bank account provided by a foreign partner, because we are government workers and the Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate foreign accounts. However, we have succeeded in transferring some of this money precisely US$5.0M (Five Million US Dollars only) into a foreign account in MOROCCO (North Africa), but the provider of the account in MOROCCO is up to some mischief and refuses to comply to the earlier mutual agreement by insisting that the total amount be paid into his nominated bank account before disbursement will take effect.  If for a meagre sum of US$5.0M (Five Million US Dollars only) we are not compensated, is it when the balance of US$22M (Twenty-two Million US Dollars)is transferred that we will be sure of our full compensation? Of course, this abuse of trust and inhumanity calls for sober reflection and search for absolute trust. Thus we are seeking your unwavering assistance that the remaining amount of US$22M can be speedily processed and fully remitted into your nominated bank account.  On successful remittance of the fund into your account, you will be compensated with 30% of the amount for your assistance and services. So far, much have been said and due to our sensitive positions, we cannot afford a slip in this transaction neither can we give out identity as regards our respective offices, but whereby cordial relationship is established, smooth operations commences, you will be furnished with details of all you deserves to know. I am at your disposition to entertain any question from you with respect to this transaction, so contact me immediately through my e:mail for further information on the requirements and procedure for this transaction. Please, treat with the strictest confidentiality and utmost urgency.

On the 6th of June 1998 an American miner, Mr. Travis Myers ran an account with us and his present balance is valued at US$28,500,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States  Dollars Only) in my Bank. We sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally, we discovered from his employers that he died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, we found out from his account file that he never made a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless, as he had none. We therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Travis Myers did not  declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents in the bank files. This sum of $28,500,000.00 is still  lying in the bank and the principal sum and interest is being rolled over at the end of every year. As it is now, no one  will ever come forward to claim this money. According to the Nigeria law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money  will revert to the ownership of the Government if unclaimed.  Consequently, my proposal is that I would like you to stand in as the next of kin of Mr. Travis Myers. This is simple; all  we need is some of your details so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which would put you in place as Mr. Myers's next of kin. We shall also employ the services of an accredited Attorney for the drafting and notarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letters of probate/administration in your  favour for the transfer. The money would be shared in the ration of 75% for us and 25% for you. There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as a manager  guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via email. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for us. I shall  still require your assistance to invest my own share in your country just incase you can help, otherwise we'll take our  share .  Awaiting your urgent reply.

UNION BANK PLC.  REPLY STRICTLY VIA: [jelendu2@indiatimes.com] Attn: sir,  Permit me to introduce myself to you, My name is Johnson Elendu., I am one of the Senior Managers in the bank I work for (Union Bank, Nigeria PLC) and I work under the Director of Foreign Exchange Operations (International Remittance). I am contacting You presently because I need your urgent assistance in a business transaction that will be of immense benefit to both of us.  I have the immediate need to transfer some money that has long been  declared "UNCLAIMED" by the chairman and some members of the board of  directors of our bank. The money is the closing balance of one of our best customers ever, Late Engr. Manfred Becker, I was his personal account officer just before he died in the ADC plane crash of 1996 in Nigeria.  Engr. Manfred Becker an American citizen was a contractor with the  Federal Government of Nigeria, he supplied and installed equipment and his company Creek land Contractors completed some of the best construction contracts in the country. His closing balance in the Bank, Union Bank of Nigeria PLC (US$40.Million) has been tagged Unclaimed because no relative of Engr. Becker has come forward to make a statement of claim. We have no knowledge of a next of kin. At this point I trust you can picture what the situation is like. We have strong proof that the chairman and the board of directors will keep most of the money for themselves and donate the remainder to a discredited military trust here in Nigeria. This invariably  is an attempt to infuse more money into the acquisition of military  equipment (arms and ammunition) for use in an already prostrate Africa.  This of course, is senseless, hence my mission.  My colleagues and my self have made several attempts at locating  persons that could be remotely related to Engr. Becker and we have been doing this  for about 4 years now. Right now I am almost alone in this enterprise and I have presently decided on moving the money to a foreign account. I am hereby soliciting your assistance and I will be very grateful if you will be willing to help in this regard.  We have access to most of what it will take to transfer the money. The only thing we do not have is a safe account. We will provide you with answers to all the security questions, which you will have to answer to move the process towards completion. We will also provide you answers to questions that only a person related to him will know. You may however not need to make any appearance; every thing will be concluded on phone and email between you and the bank [UNION BANK NIGERIA PLC, LAGOS] for your participation you will get 30%, 5% has been earmarked for the expenses that may be incurred on both ends. 65%shall be for my colleague and I.  I make this proposal in trust and in good faith, therefore, if you are interested and you agree to assist me then contact me immediately you receive this email, there is a lot more to talk about. If you are not interested, then, please, do get rid of this email and please forgive me if this message has upset you in any way.  Thank you and best regards.

My mother died when I was just 10 years old,and sin  ce then my father took me  and my junior brother so special. Before his death on Febuary 12 2002 he  called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him that he has  the sum of ten million,seven hundred thousand United State Dollars. (USD$10.700,000) left in one of the leading security company here in Abidjan  Ivroy coast West Africa.  He further told him that he deposited the money in my name,and finally issued a  written instruction to his lawyer whom he said is in possession of all the necessary  but legal documents to this fund and the security company .

This business proposal to you is strictly confidential, with due  respect. Sorry at this perceived confusion or stress you may have receiving this  letter from me, Since we have not known ourselves or met previously.  Despite that, I am constrained to write you this letter because of the  urgency it requires.As amatter of fact, I got your contact through the internet and decided to write you immediately believing you will be of a great assistance to my kids and me.  My decision to consult you for a partnership business of mutual benefit is indeed personal.Iam not in doubt that you can be trusted in financial related matters of this magnitude.

We have suffered maltreatment and untold hardship in the hands of my  late husbands family, simple because Iam not from the same tribe with my late husband.His brothers have taken all that I suffered with  my husband to acquire including treasure, houses and his bank accounts  closed by them. I wanted to escape to the United States of America [USA} with my children on exile, but again they conspired and stole my international passport and other traveling document to further frustrate me. Thank God, a week ago, I received  Key Text Code (KTC} from an offshore payment center[OPC]in overseas via our family lawyer that my late husband deposited the sum of U.S $15.7 Million[Fifteen Million Seven Hundred Thousand United States Dollars] in cash with this company,hence my late husband's brothers would not allow me to have any telephone contact with anybody.  It has therefore, become very necessary and urgent to contact someone,  a foreigner like you who can travel to the offshore payment center on  our behalf to help me  receive/secure these funds and to help invest it on our behalf as well,  while we find a way of getting out to meet with you in your country.  These funds are kept on a CODE with the Security Company to avoid  detection,  seizure or diversion. I have had several discussions with with our family lawyer who has express willingness to help me with the necessary documents for the claim of the funds from the security company should I get an honest,competent and capable foreigner who will not cheat my kids and me or even sit on the funds after claiming it, to stand on our behalf to claim the funds. This is why I have contacted you to help save my children and I from this obnoxious tax levelled on us by my late husbund's brothers by claiming these funds and investing it  on our behalf.  But, you would need to give me sufficient assurance that if you help  me, you would not divert the funds. My children and I have resolved to  give you 20% of the total sum. This is all my children and I have got  to live on. Please, I have reposed my confidence and trust in you and hope you will not disappoint me.  I will forward you the contact of our family lawyer for you  to get in touch with him immediately hence he will be the one to deal with you on the transaction to avoid suspicion from my late husband's brothers.  I look forward to your urgent response.  THANKS AND God bless.  Mrs.cecilia aku ", 'URGENT ASSISTANT NEEDED.

(Executive Manager)  Private Tel/Fax: 234-1-7598296  Private E-mail: philjones1@uboot.com  Dear Sir,  I am Mr. Philip jones, an official with one of the APEX  banks in Nigeria.My colleagues and I have an urgent  and very confidential  business proposal for you. On the 6th of June 1998 an  American miner, Mr. Travis Myers ran an account with  us and his present balance is valued at  US$28,500,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million, Five Hundred  Thousand United States Dollars Only) in my Bank. We  sent a routine notification to his forwarding address  but got no reply. After a month, we  sent a reminder and finally, we discovered from his  employers that he died from an automobile accident. On  further investigation, we found out from his account  file that he never made a will and all attempts to  trace his next of kin was fruitless, as he had none.  We therefore made further investigations and  discovered that Mr. Travis Myers did not declare any  next of kin or relations in all his official documents  in the bank files. This sum of $28,500,000.00 is still  lying in the bank and the principal sum and interest  is being rolled over at the end of every year. As it  is now, no one will ever come forward to claim this  money. According to the Nigeria law, at the expiration  of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the  ownership of the Government if unclaimed.  Consequently, my proposal is that I would like you  to stand in as the next of kin of Mr. Travis Myers.  This is simple; all we need is some of your details so  that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents  and affidavits which would put you in place as Mr.  Myers's next of kin. We shall also employ the services  of an accredited Attorney for the drafting and  notarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary  documents and letters of probate/administration in  your favour for the transfer. The money would be  shared in the ration of 75% for us and 25% for you.  There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this  transaction will be done by the Attorney and my  position as a manager guarantees the successful  execution of this transaction. If you are interested,  please reply immediately via email.  Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest  assured that this transaction would be most profitable  for us. I shall still require your assistance to  invest my own share in your country just incase you  can help, otherwise we'll take our share .  Awaiting your urgent reply,  Mr.Philip Jones. ", "Important Business Proposition Dear Sir/Madam,  I am writting this letter out of a genuine desperation to find a reliable partner in the unfolding transaction.I have been unjustly treated by my partner in a transaction so,I seek your help, attention and genuine co-operation to our mutual benefit and  i believe that you will not let down the trust and confidence i am about to repose on you.  I am MR.FRED OBI,from NIGERIA and for the past ten years,I have been working in a public Relations firm that pays me about 100 hundred dollars each month. On the 30th of june,our company made a very big financial breakthrough when we made contact with ALHAJI DAN MUSA. We began to supply him his cow vaccine named LIM KXT COW VACCINE. ALHAJI DAN MUSA is THE PRESIDENT OF (WICDEL GROUP COMPANY )He is a millionaire farmer with CATTLE FARMS in all part of AFRICA , and a new one located at ABIDJAN COTE D'VOIRE.  Moreover, he is the greatest supplier of cattle beef and other dairy products to the whole of West Africa.HE had informed us about the huge amount of money he spends on the purchase of a particular but very important cattle medicine. Precisely, he buys U  S$5,000 per carton. He asked if our organisation can source for a cheaper supplier.  We did market research and discovered that we can buy these vaccine in Europe for US$2,000 per carton. We moved a proposal to WICDEL GROUP COMPANY, to supply him at US$4,800 per carton which they accepted. As these supplies progressed and our company is  doing fine,I requested to my boss for an increase in our salary.he was so upset that he sacked me without benefits and ten years of dedicated workmanship.  I was so desperate that I went to the WICDEL GROUP COMPANY farms and infomed ALHAJI DAN MUSA that I have a foriegn contact that will be willing to supply him this same products at US$4,400. Per carton. ALHAJI DAN MUSA in turn confided to me that he is about to place order for one thousand cartons following a suspected outbreak of disease in his farms.I asured ALHAJI DAN MUSA that my foreing contact will be in the position to manufacture and supply to him,infact I convinced him that my former boss usually buy from my foriegn contact and that is why he sales to him at a higher price. HOWEVER,I INFORMED ALHAJI DAN MUSA THAT HE WILL HAVE TO PAY CASH IN ADVANCE BEFORE MY FORIEGN CONTACT WILL SUPPLY TO HIM. For the moment he has stopped all contact with my boss.  Please consider on how to handle this profitable project and kindly contact me immediately through my private e-mail: fredobi@indiatimes.com  for more details and negotiations as regards my commission.However,I will insist that my commission will be 20% of the total profit.  Note : We will buy one thousand carton at US$2,000,000. We sell to them at US$4,400,000 Dollars, our client pays cash before lifting of the goods. (They must not know our purchase point in (Europe).

I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of  us at the end of the transaction . During our investigation and auditing in this bank,my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash on the 26th December 1998 on airline transafrik International with aircraft Lockheed L-100-30 at location Vila Nova,Angola with registration number S9-CAO and since his untimely death the funds has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development. Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself and partners to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amount was US$24.1M (Twenty Four million One Hundred Thousand united states dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through my a friends who works with the Ministry of Information here in Cotonou-Benin. It is him who recommended your person to me to be viable and capable to champion a business of such magnitude without any problem. Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased,get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit yourself to this great business opportunity. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant,we  are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designated bank account. May I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as I have made arrangements for a successful arrangement as an insider of the bank before contacting you.  On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone bills, while 60% will be for me and my partners. Please, you have been adviced to keep this a top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary information will be sent to you on your acceptance to champion this transaction with me.

Though, I don't know to what extent you are familiar with events and disturbances in Sierra-Leone but it had consistent features in the BBC, CNN news bulletins. The pressure of war drove my family out of Sierra-Leone into exile in Spain where we have been living under political asylum for three years. Sadly, my mother died of cancer 4 months ago and was buried in Madrid. Prior to her death, she gave me a certificate of a secret deposit that my father made in a security company in Europe (destination will be disclosed later for security reasons) The money $45,000,000.00 (forty-five million dollars) was deposited as family treasure. He did this with a view to converting it to his personal use at the end of the war but was killed as a result of his opposition to the rebel forces when the conflict intensified. I have however  contacted the security company to confirm the deposit and establish ownership. Due to the death of my mother and the continued hostility in Sierra-Leone, I have decided to solicit the assistance of an honest and trustworthy person or company that will assist in investing the money. I cannot do it alone due to my present political status and total ignorance of the business world. You will be given a negotiable percentage of the money at the end of the transaction. If you are honest, trustworthy and interested in the above proposal, contact me immediately through my email address for more details. You must maintain absolute confidentiality in order to ensure success. Please, indicate your personal telephone/fax numbers when replying. Best Regards, Thomas Sesay Karimu.

I am Dr. HASSAN DIKO,the chief accountant of The Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and I head a five man tender board in charge of contract award and payment approvals.I came to know of you in my search for a reliable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.  There were series of contracts executed by a consortion of  multinationals in the oil industry in favour of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) among which were for the following:  1. The expansion of the pipelines network within for a crude down stream products distribution and subsequent evacuation which cost $8bUSD(8 Billion United States Dollars).  2. Contract for the turn around maintenance (TAM) of the various refineries in the country $115 million Uited States Dollars.  . The construction of storage tanks for petrolwum products (depots) $190 Million United States Dollars.  The original value of these contracts were delebrately over invoiced in the sum $69mUSD (sixty nine Million United States Dollars Only) which has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred, being that the companies that actually executed these contracts had been fully paid when the projests were officially commissioned.  It does not matter whether your comapny did the contract or not, the assumption is that your company won the major contract and sub-contracted it out to other companies.  Consequently, my colleaques and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil service laws) from opening and or operating foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust imposed on you at this junction is  enormous.  In return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 5% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between the parties in the course of the transaction, and the remaining 75% is for us,the Nigerian officials.  Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the fund within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms.  Our assurance is that your role is risk free,I accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the fund,the whole approval procedures will be officially and legally processed with the name of any company you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary of the above mentioned amount.  Therefore, when the business is successfully concluded we shall through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the concerned government ministries for 100% security risk free.  Once more, I want you to understand that having put in over 19 years in the civil service of my country, I am very careful to have my image and career deemed.

I come to you with a sincere heart believing in Almighty Allah that you will consider my plight and come to help and also benefit from me.  I am Mrs. Amina Mohammed, cousin and Personal Assistant to former Nigeria Head of State, Late General Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th July 1998 while in power.

Actually I got your contact from the Internet; please do not feel bad about it because I am compelled to reach you due to urgent need to safeguard the money in question. Once again, forgive me and come to my aid. Please read the following carefully.  Sometime in early 1997, my boss late Gen. Sanni Abacha entrusted to me the sum of US$20.5M in cash (Twenty million, five hundred thousand US dollars) due to the trust and confidence he had in me. This money was meant for campaign in is self-succession bid but unfortunately he suddenly died before actualization of his aspiration. This amount of $20.5M in CASH was deposited with a security company, which I will disclose in subsequent mail in a giant trunk box as diplomatic consignments In agreement with Mr.Mohammed Abacha who is the son of Late General Abacha and the heir to the money. I write to solicit your Assistance for the money to be transferred to your custody.

I am Dr. Ken Dikko, the Project Director of Nitel at the above address. Following my intentions of owning an offshore investment, I was urged to  contact a foreigner  to assist in facilitating the  immediate release  of $14Million United States Dollars into his/her bank account to jointly execute my motive of securing  an offshore  investment. This was because Nigeria\'s  civil service code of conduct does  not allow a civil  servant to own an offshore account or investment outside the shores of Nigeria. Sequel to this, I was able to contact a foreigner (Mr. Jim Walsh) an American based in Nigeria to assist  with the transfer.  He agreed and we  proceeded  in procuring all documents necessary to  facilitate the  immediate release of the funds into his custody using him as a Project Consultant to the Nigerian  Telecommunication. The money was as a result of an over-invoiced contract on contract  number "ntl-fgn01/ped-98" for the  procurement, supply  and installation of  Telecommunication equipment to Nitel regional offices up to the tune of $52Million United States Dollars.  It was awarded to a  Swiss Contractor who executed  the contract and was fully paid i.e $38Million United  States Dollars leaving aside $14Million United States Dollars. Final payment approval was granted on behalf of Mr. Jim Walsh by the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF)  to the paying bank while waiting for the payment  application from him to the bank but he suddenly died of Cardiac Arrest leaving no  Next of kin/beneficiary to the funds. It is as a result of this, that I am contacting  you to  please stand as the next of kin to Mr.  Jim Walsh and new beneficiary  to the funds to  enable the funds to be transfered into your custody. All documents to back up your claim will be giving  to you adequately  while a Memorandum of  Understanding (MOU) will be reached between us to safe guard our both interest in line of this transaction. I am willing to compensate you with 25% of the total funds while the rest 75% will be for me for the  investments in your country as well as assuring  you that this transaction is 100% risk free and legal. If this proposal is okay to you, please kindly get back to me to enable  me demand certain informations  and briefing for the commencement of this transaction. Please always quote the reference number above in all correspondences to me while confidentiality should be  our watch word. I await your urgent response. Sincere regards, Dr. Ken Dikko.

Dear Sir, I am Mr Kalada Hart, Bank Manager of Orient Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have an urgent and very confidential business  proposition for you. On September 6, 1997, a Canadian Oil consultant/contractor with  the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Jerry Sheldon  made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months,  valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding  address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and  finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian  National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Jerry Sheldon died from  an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that  he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next  of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that  Mr. Jerry Sheldon did not declare any kin or relations in all his  official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the  interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each  year. No one has ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian  Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the  ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the  next of kin to Mr. Jerry Sheldon so that the fruits of this old man's  labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government official s. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full  names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary  documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.  We shall employ the service of two Attorney for drafting and notarization  of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/ administration in your favor for the transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then  facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of  70% for me and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be  done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guaranttees  the successful execution of this transaction.

Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either  a Christian organization or a  devoted Christian individual that will utilize this money the way  I am going to instruct here in.    I want this Christian organization or individual to use this  money in all sincerity to fund  churches, orphanages, widows and also propagating the word of God  and to ensure that the society  upholds the views and beliefs of the holy bible. The holy bible  emphasized so much on the giving  of alms, charity and this has encouraged me in taking this bold  step. I took this decision  because I don't have any child and my late husband's relatives  are all Muslims and I don't want  my husband&#8217;s hard earned money to be misused by people that call  me an unbeliever. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an  unholy manner hence the reasons for  taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with  God the highest and the most  merciful one. I don't need any telephone communications but will  only give you the contact of my  lawyer because he is the one who is going to assist you in making  you the beneficiary of the  consignment in the finance and security firm if you receive this  letter and accept to assist me  to conclude this transaction, if you want to speak with me he  will arrange for that because my  doctor warned me not to talk for too long a time and secondly, I  can't discuss in the presence of my husbands relatives for they always stay with me in the  hospital, my lawyer is the only person  that knows the decision that I am taking. With God, I know that all things are possible and as soon as I  receive your reply through my  lawyer I will now give him instruction to make you the  beneficiary of the consignment and all  necessary steps to take before receiving these funds and I shall  also give you the contact of the finance and security firm I will also issue you a letter of  authority that will prove you as the  original beneficiary of the funds. I want you and the Christian  community where you reside to  always pray for me.  My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted Christian  though married to a Muslim,  whoever that wants to serve God must serve him in truth and in  spirit, please always be prayerful  all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room  in souring for another Christian organization or a devoted Christian for the same purpose.  Until I hear from you my dreams will rest squarely on your  shoulders, may the Almighty God  continue to guide and protect you. Amen.

O With due respect trust and humility, I write you this proposal, which I believe will be a great interest to you. I found your contact while I was doing a private research on the Internet for a reliable and capable foreign partner that will assist my family and I. That's why I contacted you. I am Prince Charles Zuma the first son of Late Mr.Morris Zuma who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I found your contact while I was doing a private research on the Internet for a reliable and capable foreign partner that will assist my family in a business transaction, hence I decided to write to you. Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to Deposit the sum of US$29 M (Twenty Nine Million United States Dollars). in a private security company, as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was deposited in a box as Precious Metals to avoid any suspicion from the security company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals and establishment of a new Commercial farm in Swaziland. This land problem came up when Zimbabwe President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a New Land Act reform, which wholly affected the rich white Commercial farmers and some few Black Commercial farmers. This resulted to killings and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans in the society. In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act for which my father is a victim. It is against this background that my family and I who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my father's money to a foreign Country since the law of South Africa prohibits refugees to transact any business with the bank. As the eldest son of my father, I am given the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign partner who will provide a foreign account where this money could be transferred into as soon as possible for the investment of my family. I must also let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free. If you accept to assist my family and me. All I want from you is for you to make arrangements and come to Johannesburg,South Africa so that you can open a non-resident account in your name which will aid us in transferring this money into any account you will nominate overseas. I have two options, firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction, or you can go into partnership with me for proper profitable investment of the money in your country.Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses that might be incured in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you 20% of the total money, while 75% will be for my family and me. If you are really capable and willing to assist me, please contact me immediately on the above telephone or by email. Finally, please treat this matter as urgent and Confidential. I intend to leave this country soonest. Thanks for your mutual co-operation. I expect your urgent response. Best Regards, PRINCE CHARLES ZUMA", 'hello my dear hello my dear, my name is aishatu ahmed.my father was recently murdered in tripoli as a result of family and friends conflicts due to a substantial amount he made while he was in the ministry.generally,most rich men keep such fund at their homes as it is illegal for one to keep such amount in any bank in lybia without a proper explaination as per how such fund was made .so these wicked people thought that this fund was still in our mansion and they tried to eliminate all our house hold in order to get free access to our home to search for it  unknowing to them that my late father had already moved the fund to a finance house in europe through diplomatic means leaving me as the beneficiary as if he forsaw the danger in our family.just one week after his burial,these people broke into our home with gun shots everywhere which resulted to the death of my only little brother.that very night,i and my mother escaped and ran to a country(by road) called burkina faso where we ar!  e for the moment in a hidden hotel.i got your contact from a consultancy firm here in burkina faso,though i did not let them know my main reason of contacting you for confidential sake as i only told them that i needed your contact for pen pals.i need your faithfully and confidential asistance to get this fund from the finance house in europe as we are financially down due to our unprepared journey to this place,ofwhich we left all our belongings and other valuables for our dear lives hoping to get this money out of the finance house.luckily for us,we came here with all the documents relating to this fund.if you have any question to ask,please feel free to do so and get back to me soonest. aishatu', 'EMAIL ME ON THIS ISSUE FROM THE DESK OF  MR JERRY OZUBA  N N P C.

There were series of contracts executed by a consortion of  multinationals in the oil industry in favour of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) among which were for the following:  1. The expansion of the pipelines network within for a crude down stream products distribution and subsequent evacuation which cost $8bUSD(8 Billion United States Dollars).  2. Contract for the turn around maintenance (TAM) of the various refineries in the country $115 million Uited States Dollars.  3. The construction of storage tanks for petrolwum products (depots) $190 Million United States Dollars.  The original value of these contracts were delebrately over invoiced in the sum $69mUSD (sixty nine Million United States Dollars Only) which has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred, being that the companies that actually executed these contracts had been fully paid when the projests were officially commissioned.  It does not matter whether your comapny did the contract or not, the assumption is that your company won the major contract and sub-contracted it out to other companies.  Consequently, my colleaques and I are willing to transfer the total  amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil service laws) from opening and or operating foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust imposed on you at this junction is  enormous.  In return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 5% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and  external) between the parties in the course of the transaction, and the remaining 75% is for us,the Nigerian  officials.  Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the fund within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the  above stated terms.  Our assurance is that your role is risk free,I accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the fund,the whole approval procedures will be officially and legally processed with the name of any company you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary of the above mentioned amount.  Therefore, when the business is successfully concluded we shall through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the concerned government ministries for 100% security risk free.  Once more, I want you to understand that having put in over 19 years in the civil service of my country, I am very careful to have my image and career deemed.  Please contact me immediately through E-mail whether you are  interested in this deal or not, if you are not, it will enable us scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal but where you are interested send the required documents.  Send by Email for security reasons with this email address jerry_640@fsmail.net  Thanks as I await in anticipation for your fullest co-operation.  Very truly yours,  JERRY.OZUBA.

EMAIL ADDR:mr_frank2020@hotmail.com  TEL:+27 83 740 2698  ATTENTION:C.E.O,  I am MR.FRANK SHABALALA, an officer incharge of delivery department in Operations GLOBAL SECURITY COMPANY,SOUTH AFRICA. Here in south Africa,Our firm is a security company of high repute with years of outstanding service to the people of Africa.  I have resolved to contact you through this medium based on business proposal that will be of mutual benefit to both of us. I got your particulars through a consultant company base on my research for a trustworthy and established person that understands investment ethic for entering into a life time profitable joint partnership investment and also co-operation with confidence and trust that you will keep the contents secret and not divulged to any third  party.  To be explicit and straight to the point. Some time early 1997, a reputable client of ours deposited a consignment in our company's vault for safe keeping. And since then our client has failed to come forward  to claim his consignment, which has accumulated a considerable amount of money in demurrage.Consequently, in our bide to contact this client to redeem the demurrage which his consignment had accumulated we discovered that our client was the former president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who died of illness after he was de-throwed in the same year the consignment was entrusted into our care.  Since the death of our client President Mobutou Sese seko, none of his benefactors has come forward to claim the consignment with us, which means that non of his relatives or aids had any knowledge of this consignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided to scanned the  box after some of workers have been dismissed for the day l find out that our client deposited in our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the  box that were registered as treasurer by our client actually contained a considerable amount of money in United States Dollars amounting to about US$35million Dollar. Since this development I have been nursing plans secretly.  I also found out from enquiries and the foreign media that our late client  siphoned a lot of money from his country while he was in office as head of state.It is my conviction that the consignment in our vault was part of the money that our client siphoned and now that he is dead there is no race to this money in our care. I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist me in transferring this money out of South Africa to your country for immediate investment with your assistance.  I have also decided that you will generously be entitled to 30% of the total amount. Upon my receipt  of your reply confirming your willingness to assist me of this transaction, I will immediately arrange and transfer all the rights of ownership of this consignment to your name to facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of the complete funds to your country, all the  documents that covers this box of consignment will be send to you  so that you as far as l concern.  you have nothing to worry about, as I will  be there to assist you in anyway necessary with all proper documentation.  This transaction is 100% risk free. Please maintain absolute confidentiality on this matter. Please reply to the above email address with your telephone and fax so that i can call you.  Thanks.

Then the balance of 5% will be  reserved for incidental expences.  I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up this transaction.

DR AHMED SANI ", 'GOOD DAY >From princess ifeoma  The Palace of King of Ogoni Kingdom,  Ogoni Oil producing community,  Rivers State Nigeria.  PRINCESS Email ADDRESS:princess_ifeoma201@hotmail.com  My lawyer phone number  234-8033072775  Email: him for more information please  Dear Sir, I am Princess IFEOMA , daughter of HRH King  Solomon Abonime, the king of Ogoni Kingdom. I am 25  years old and a graduate of Mass Communication. My  father was the king of Ogoni Kingdom the highest oil  producing area in Nigeria. He was in charge of  reviving royalties from the multi-national oil  companies and government on behalf of the oil  producing communities in Nigeria. After the hanging of  the Ogoni Nine(9) including Ken Saro Wiwa by the late  dictator General Sani Abacha, my father suffered  stroke and died in August27th last year. But before  his death, he called me and told me he has sixthy six Million United States Dollars  (USD66,000,000.00) cash in his possession, specially  deposited in a Security vault company in eroupe. He  advised me not to tell anybody except my mother who is  the last wife of the (8) eight wives that he married.  My mother did not bear any male child for him. Which  implies that all my father?s properties, companies  e.t.c., we have no share in them because my mother has  no male child according to African Tradition. My  father therefore secretly gave me all the relevant  documents of the said money, and told me that I should  use this money with my mother and my younger sisters  because he knows that tradtionally, if he dies we  cannnot get anything, as inheritance. He importantly  advised me that I should seek foreign assistannce and  that I should not invest this money here in Nigeria  because of his other wives and male children who  happen to be my elders. I am soliciting for your  immediate assistance to get a Bungalow for us, where I  will live with my mother and two younger sisters and  further advise me where and how I will invest the  balance money overseas, possibly on products of your  company and other profitable ventures. I believe that  by the special grace of God, you will help us move  this money out of eroupe to your country where we can  invest this money judiciously with you. You are  entitled to a reasonable part of this money based on  our agreement, and God will bless you as you help us.  PLease reply through my e-mail Looking forward to hear  from you as soon as possibleand also my lawyer  email address:(adekunle_smithmike@hotmail.com). Regards. Princess  Ifeoma.  NB This is my email address:princess201@fastermail.com ', 'GOOD DAY TO YOU!!! Dear Beloveth, I am Prince Fayad W. Bolkiah, the eldest son of Prince Jefri Bolkiah, former Finance Minister of Brunei, the tiny oil-rich sultanate on the Gulf Island. I will save your time by not amplifying my extended royal family history, which  has already been disseminated by the international media during the controversial dispute that erupted between my father and his step brother, the sultan of Brunei Sheik Muda Hassanal Bolkiah. As you may know from the international media, the sultan had accused my father of financial mismanagement and impropriety of US$14.8 Billion dollars. This was as a result of the Asian financial crisis that made my father company Amedeo Development Company and government owned Brunei Investment Company to be declared bankrupt during his tenure in office. However my father was kept under house arrest, his bank accounts and private properties including a crude oil export refinery were later confiscated by the  sultanate. Furthermore, during this unfortunate period i was advised to evacuate my immediate family outside the sultanate to avoid further prosecution from the sultan and his security operatives, but before I could do that I was placed under house arrest by the Sultan and i have no access to a phone but I have a Palm V hand-held computer from which I am sending you this mail. Before my In-castration, I went ahead to dispatch the sum of Five Hundred  Million United States Dollars US$500 Million in cash under special arrangement  into the custody of different Private security and Trustee companys for safe keeping abroad. The money where splitted and kept in the following countries in this proportion: US$50 Million is in Switzerland, US$100 Million is in London, US$100 Million is in Malaysia, US$80 Million is in United Arab Emirate and the balance US$US170 Million is in Holland. Hence I seek your good assistance to invest these funds into profitable investment in your country to facilitate future survival for my family abroad.I have decided to offer 10% of these funds to you as compensation for your strong cooperation. Please I count on your absolute confidentiality,transparency and trust while looking forward to your prompt reply towards a swift conclusion of this  business transaction. I remain yours sincerely Prince Fayad .W. Bolkiah Brunei Darussalam. please reply to my privite email address-ROYALMAJESTY@K.RO                                                                       ', 'From Reverend Ngoly Dear Friend,  First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction. This   is by the virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential. I am sure  and have confidence of your ability and reliability to prosecute  a transaction of this great magnitude.  We want to transfer (US$150,000,000.00) One hundred and fifty million  United States Dollars from an investment bank in Port Au-Prince,  Haiti to a reliable overseas account.I solicit your assistance to enable us  transfer the said amount into your safe account for onward investment.  You can either provide us with an existing account or to set up a new  bank account immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c  can serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to  me till the end for this important business trusting in you and believing  that you will never let us down either now or in the future.  My name is Rev.Ngo Ngoly. I am the Head of International Operations of a prime commercial bank  here in Bangui, Central African Republic. I have been mandated by a  senior Aide of the exiled Leader of Republic of Haiti, Jean Bertrand  Aristide who have just been abducted and forced to exile in Bangui,  CAR together with his families and aides by the American and French  government, to solicit for a reliable individual or company whom we  can present as a front to effect the transfer of this funds out of Haiti.  The owner has secured this amount with a fictitious name at a bank  in Haiti. This Aide has equally assured me that with the assistance  of their colleagues who are still holding most key post in the financial  power bases of their country, it is not a problem to have the funds  transferred out of the investment bank in Haiti to any other part of  the world except my county, CAR. It is not a good idea to transfer  this amount to my country directly from Haiti due to the fact that my  country is one of the poorest nations in the whole world.  Secondly, the whole world is aware that Mr.Aristide has just arrived in  this country some few days ago to live in exile, it must definitely raise  a big dust when the money arrives here. With my position and  influence in the bank over here, the money can be transferred to  any foreign reliable account that you can provide within 10 days  with assurance that this money will be left untouched until our  physical arrival in your country for sharing. I have secretly discussed  this business with my colleague who also holds a strategic portfolio in  my bank and he has willingly agreed to join the train.  The 20% of this amount will be for you while the remaining balance will  be for all of us here. Please reply immediately if you are interested in this business but if you wish not to participate in the deal for any  reason that will only be known to you and kindly keep all this details strictly  to your self. I will provide you with the full details and our mode of the  operations once I receive your positive response in these regards.

He  died after a brief illness that lasted for only four  days. Before his death we were both born again  Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry  or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the  Bible is against.When my late husband was alive he  deposited the sum of$27.6Million (twenty-seven Million  six hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with one  finance/security company in Europe.  Presently, this money is still with the Security  Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not  last for the next three months due to cancer problem.  Though what disturbs me most is my stroke.   Having known my condition I decided to donate this  fund to church or better still a christian individual  that will utilize this money the way I am going to  instruct here in. I want a church or individual that  will use this to fund churches, orphanages and widows  propagating the word of God and to ensure that the  house of God is maintained.

I am Hajia Mariam Abacha, wife of Nigeria�s former head of state; Late General Sani Abacha, whose sudden death occurred on the 8th of June 1998. Since my husband died, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration. The security agents in the country have subjected me to physical and psychological torture. My son (Mohammed Abacha) is still under detention arraigned before the federal high court of Nigeria for an offence he did not commit. As a widow that is so traumatized, I am hopeless with my present faith.  You must have heard over the media reports on the recovery of various sums of money deposited by my late husband with various security firms. Some companies willingly gave up their secret and disclosed our money confidently lodged there, or many, outright blackmail.  Infact the total sum discovered by the government so far is in the tune of $700 Million USD and they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I came in contact with your name and address in a website and would want to have good confidence in you as I view you to be a responsible personality.  I have no doubt about your capacity and goodwill to assist me in receiving into your custody( for safety) the sum of $50 Million USD willed and deposited safely in my favour by my late husband. This money is currently kept in Safe Deposit Box (SDB) at a security firm within Europe. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband�s property is under the authority of the family�s Lawyer (Attorney)Barrister MIKE AHAMBA(SAN). The investigative teams set up by government have submitted their report after freezing almost all our account. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the $50m USD be urgently moved to an overseas account of any trust worthy but ANNONYMOUS foreign family friend without delay, for security reasons.  All our traveling papers have been seized by the government thereby preventing us from traveling and all the local and international outfit of our business empire seized. This sum of money is our only hope to stay alive. I have therefore agreed to compensate your goodself with 10% of the total deposit when you finally the deposit box from the security firm and lodged in your account.  They have equally guaranteed 100% risk-free and smooth transfer. If you are interested in assisting me,you can write me through my e-mail, please reply direct to this email address; dr_mrsabacha@sify.com  for obvious security reasons, it is imperative that you keep all our communication very secret. Donot mention my family"s name or disclose the transaction to anybody. If you are not interested in assisting me, still get in touch so that I can make alternative arrangement as time is of the essence.Please do not expose me.

I want to also bring to your notice that  as the Head of the Audit department of this bank if this fund is not pulled  out before our auditing the fund fund will be discovered by my colleagues  and that will definately lead to the government confiscating the money into  the federation account.  You might ask what will be the proceedure to achieve this. As soon as I  get your positive response to assist me, I will then send to you the proceedure  and the next step to follow. So if this meets your interest then get back  to me to enable me send to you the procedure of claiming this fund. I have  in my possetion all the necessary information of the deceased (MR.

I got your contact through my research in the South African Chambers of  Commerce & Industries for a responsible and a God fearing person who I  can trust by using his personality and his bank account for this  transaction. When I got your contact, I prayed over it then I decided  to write to you.  Before the death of my father, he deposited the sum of USD$10 Million  (TENMILLION UNITDED STATES DOLLARS) in one of the private security  companies, in Johannesburg South Africa as if he fore saw the looming danger in  Zimbabwe.  This money is protected in a big metal box and was declared to the  security company at the point of deposit as precious valuables e.g.:  Gold, diamond and germ stone to avoid the security company knowing that the  content of the consignment deposited with them contains cash. This amount was  meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and  establishment of a new farm in Swaziland.  This land problem came when Zimbabwe President MR.ROBERT MUGABE  introduced a New Land Act reform, which wholly affected the rich white  and some few black farmers. This resulted to killing and mob action by Zimbabwean  warveterans. In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land  reform act for which my father was one of the victims.  It is for this reason that my family and i who are staying in South  Africa now as refugees have decided to transfer my father's money to a  foreign country since the law of South Africa prohibits a person with a refugee  status to operate a bank account or do any banking transaction in South  Africa.

I got your particulars through a consultant company  base on my research for atrustworthy and established  person that understands investment ethic for entering  into a life time profitable joint partnership  investment and also co-operation with confidence and  trust that you willkeep the contents secret and  divulged to any third party.  To be explicit and straight to the point. Some time  early 1997, a reputable client of ours deposited  aconsignment in our company\\'s vault for safe  keeping.And since then our client has failed to come  forward to claim his consignment, which has  accumulated aconsiderable amount of money in  demurrage.Consequently, in our bide to contact this  client to redeem the demurrage which his consignment  had accumulated we discovered that our client was the  former president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who  died of illness after he was de-throwed in the same  year the consignment was entrusted into our care.Since  the death of our client President Mobutou Seseseko,  none of his benefactors has come forward to claim the  consignment with us, which means that non of his  relatives or aids had any knowledge of this  consignment.  Hence out of curiosity I decided to secretly open the  two boxes that our client deposited in our vault. And  to my surprise I discovered that the two boxes that  were registered as treasurer by our client actually  contained a considerable amount of money in United  States Dollars amounting to about US$30 million  Dollar.

FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT. INTERNATIONAL BANK OF AFRICA OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO. Sir, I am MR OMARU AMINU,the director,in charge of Auditing and Accounting  section of International Bank of Africa Ouagadougou Burkina faso,in West  Africa in due respect and regards.I have decided to contact you on a  business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end  of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in the bank, my department came across  a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person, a foreigner who  died on november 2000  in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his  account with the bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either  from his family or relation before our discovery to this development. Although personally,i kept this information secret within myself and  partners to enable the whole plans and idea be profitable and successful  during the time of execution.The said amount was USD$14m (fourteen million  united states dollars). As it may intrest you to know, I got your contact  through international business enquiry on internet. I believe you will be viable and capable to champion a business of such  magnitude without any problem. Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put  claim over this fund as the bona fide next of kin to the deceased, get the  required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put  in place and directives/needed information will be relayed to you as soon as  you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit  your self to this great business opportunity. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this  country as a civil servant,we are not allowed to operate a foreign account  and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of  transfer because I work in this bank.This is the actual reason why it will  require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin  with affidavit of trust of Oath to the bank and also present a foreign  account where he will need the money to be re-transfered into on his request  as it may be, after due verification and clarification by designated bank  account. I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On  smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the  total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of  expenses that may arise during the time of transfer such as telephone bills  etc, while 60% will be for me and my partners. Please,you have been advised  to keep top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from  service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole  situation here in the bank until you confirm the money in your account.And  ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund  according to percentages previously indicated and further investment,either  in your country or any other country you may advice us to invest in.All  other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you.I  suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this  deal.

Dear Friend,  I am the manager of billing and exchange at the  foreign remittance department of BANCO POPULARE DE ESPANA here in Madrid Spain. In my department. we discovered an abandoned sum of ??m euros (FOURTY Million  euros) in an account that belongs to one of our  foreign customer (MR. Rudi Fassnacht from Cologne, Germany) who died along with his entire family in Jully 2000 in a  plane crash.For more informations about the crash you  can visit this site:  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm  Since we got information about his death, we have been  expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his  money because we cannot release it unless some body  applies for it as next of kin or relation to the  deceased as indicated in our banking guidlings and  laws but unfortunately we  learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation  died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving  nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this  discovery that I now decided to make this business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the  next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and  subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it  and we don't want this money to go into the Spanish  treasury government account as unclaimed funds.  The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if  such money remained unclaimed after five years, the  money will be transfered into the government treasury  account as unclaimed funds. The request of foreigner  as next of kin  in this business is occassioned by the fact that the  customer was a foreigner and a Spanish cannot stand as  next of kin to a foreigner.  I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a  respect to the provision of a foriegn account ,10%  will be set aside for expenses incurred during the  business and 60% will be invested in any lucrative  business of your choice and as soon as this is done, i  will resign from my work and join you immediatelly.  Remmember that the trust leed upon you is based on  mutual business understanding and a life time  opportunity which i believe you will not allow it go.  To enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you  as arranged,you must apply first to the bank as  relation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of  application  that i will send to you,so i will like you to send to  me your private telephone and fax number for easy and  effective communication and location where the money  will be remitted.  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax  or email the text of the application . I will not fail  to bring to your notice this transaction is hitch-free  and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as  All required arrangements have been made for the  transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as  you receive this letter.

Until recently I had investments in oil and construction in Baghdad. Since the war started in this country my life has been thrown into severe mystery. I lost my wife and two children to bombs dropped in the city. Today, I�m in a hospital in China with very fatal injuries and I have lost my ability to talk. My doctors have indicated that my chances of survival are very slim. I have therefore decided that part of my fortunes should be distributed to charity works to help victims of the war in sudan, iraq and other war zones and the rest part held in trust by you and use in  future for charity purpose. Before this happened my business and concern for making money was all I lived for.  I never really cared about other values in life. But since the loss of my family, I have found a  new desire to assist helpless families and victims of humanitarian crisis. Shortly after the first gulf war I deposited the sum of  USD$8.5 million dollars  with a financial company in Europe,given the complete ruin and disorder in the country I have no knowledge of any relative who would be available to help me carry out this last wish.  Please I want you to help me collect the deposit  from the company in Europe and distribute it accordingly. I want you to use your discretion and judgement to re-emburse yourself at the end of the day for  all expenses you will incure during the collection and distribution of funds. If you are willing to help, please reply as soon as you can so we can look at your reward and the things you need to do to collect the money. Lastly, A list of this orgainization you intend to distribute this funds to will be highly appreciated. Upon your reply I shall send you the certifiate of deposit and ownership certificate that was issued at the time I deposited the Funds with them. I will also be sending to you my international passport upon your reply. May the good God bless you and your family.

For your benefit of doubt, we [ my partners & I] are  management  officials in the board team of the above named government parastatal. In  addition, we are members of the internal audit reveiw panel set up to  reconcile all bonifide contract debts being owed to foreigners by the government of Nigeria. In the course of our auditing, we came across the siad sum of $14m  floating in the ministry escrow account as an accrued debt payable to a yet  un-identified contractor since 2001.On thorough examination,it was  discovered that the $14M was a debt brilliantly created by the former  Director General in favour of a company that she was about to incorporate  locally here with the help of a foreign partner. We made consultations with the former DG and eventually struck an  agreement with her.The masterplan she created remains the same.The plan is  to make you the chief beneficiary to the $14M by way of advancing  you/your company as the real contractor to whom the sum is owed by the  Ministry for a project executed between 2000/2001.As a matter of  fact,all  the modalities needed to acheive this has already been perfected. The  overall plan is 100% foolproof and will be carried out legally in every  aspect of the transaction. Specifically,your duty will be to act in  correspondence (viaE-mails,Faxes & Telephone)- with the local Ministry of  Finance as well as the Apex Bank authorities; until your total claims are  verified,approved and the money paid into your advised bank account. Whereas we would like to maintain our full confidentiality for now, we   shall however provide you with more details as to the masterplan and  the entire time frames involved. We will do so when you indicate your  interest to become a partner with us. Looking forward to a cordial business partnership with you.

I am pleased to get across to you for a profitable business proposal,  though I don't know you and we had never meant in person but I got your  contact from the Personal Assistance to the former Minister for Sports.  More so she told me that this is your first time in partaking in such  business but you are in a better position to handle the  transaction/business of this magnitude without you running away with our  own share of fund once your account is credited within 4 -5 working days  because before I commence we have to build mutual relationship in respect  of this business that is strictly confidential and all the legal  /essential documents to back up this transaction are in place. And the key  for us building up this mutual relationship is TRUST between both parties  involved that is you and I.  I am in charge of the Auditing for contract  payment with SAFA (South African Football Association) and I truly  apologize for using this means to reach you because I have no other  choice.Within the South African Football Association and the cooperation  of my colleague, I have in my possession as overdue payment bills totaling  Eighteen Million Three Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (US$18,3M). With  your assistance and fullest co-operation, I on behalf of my colleague beg  you to help us receive these funds by wire transfer that is presently  lying in a suspended account with ABSA Bank in Pretoria branch. It does  matter whether it is a cooperate or personal account but as long as the  account is active to receive the amount of this magnitude, it is very ok  to us. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South  Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not permit us to operate  offshore/foreign account of any kind hence you are very important to wards  the successful completion of this whole transaction that we shall both  benefits from.

Here in  NIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high repute  with years of outstanding service to the people of  Africa.  I have resolved to contact you through this medium  based on business proposal that will be of mutual  benefit to both of us. I got your particulars through  a consultant company base on my research for a  trustworthy and established person that understands  investment ethic for entering into a life time  profitable joint partnership investment and also  co-operation with confidence and trust that you will  keep the contents secret and divulged to any third  party.  To be explicit and straight to the point. Some time  early 1997, a reputable client of o! urs deposited a  consignment in our company's vault for safe keeping.  And since then our client has failed to come forward  to claim his consignment, which has accumulated a  considerable amount of money in demurrage.  Consequently, in our bide to contact this client to  redeem the demurrage which his consignment had  accumulated we discovered that our client was the  former president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who  died of illness after he was de-throwed in the same  year the consignment was entrusted into our care.  Since the death of our client President Mobutou  Seseseko, none of his benefactors has come forward to  claim the consignment with us, which means that non of  his relatives or aids had any knowledge of this  consignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided to  secretly open the two boxes that our client deposited  in our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the  two boxes that were registered as treasure! r by our  client actually contained a considerable amount of  money in United States Dollars amounting to about  US$30 million Dollar. Since this development I have  been nursing plans secretly. I also found out from  enquiries and the foreign media that our late client  siphoned a lot of money from his country while he was  in office as head of state.  It is my conviction that the consignment in our vault  was part of the money that our client siphoned and now  that he is dead there is no race to this money in our  care.  I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist me  in transferring this money out of nigeria to your  country for immediate investment with your assistance.  I have also decided that you will generously be  entitled to 30% of the total amount. Upon my receipt  of your reply confirming your willingness to assist me  of this transaction, I will immediately arrange and  transfer all the rights of ownership of thisconsignment to  your name to facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of the  complete funds to your  country.  you have nothing to worry about, as I will be there  to assist you in anyway necessary with all proper  documentation.  This transaction is 100% risk free.  Please maintain absolute confidentiality on this  matter.  Please reply to the above email address with your  telephone and fax so that i can call you.  Thanks.  Yours faithfully.  MR.VICTOR KOVIS  -------------------------------------------------  sent by Excite Inbox - http://inbox.excite.co.uk  powered by Excite UK - http://www.excite.co.uk ", 'RE;  VERY  IMPORTANT Dear Sir/Madam,  This mail will definitely be coming to you as a surprise, but I must  crave your indulgence to introduce myself to you.  I am Mr. John mensah Sulikuh, a supervisory manager at the United Trust Bank  Ltd,London. However I got your contact through the International web  directory.Recently we discovered a Dormant Account with a huge Amount of  Money  ValuedUSD17, 600,000.00 (Seventeen Million, six hundred Dollars Only) that  belongs to One of our late Customer MR. KRAANVOGEL DIONIJS. who died In a  plane crash. During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my  Department came Across a very huge sum of money belonging to MR.  KRAANVOGEL DIONIJS from Beverwijk, Netherlands, who died along with his  wife, MRS. KATRIEN DIONIJS and Daughter, MS. SOFIE DIONIJS so the fund has  Been dormant in his account with this Bank without Any claim of the fund in  our custody either from his Family or relation before Our discovery to this  development.  The Banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for 15  years, it will be forfeited to the Bank Treasury as an unclaimed bill. It is  only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and it is upon this  discovery that I decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out  this dormant fund.In order to avert this negative development. On behalf of  my trusted colleagues we now seek your permission to have you stand in as  next of kin to Our late Customer so that the fund will be released and  paid into your account as the beneficiary’s next of kin now that the bank is  still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased, MR. KRAANVOGEL  DIONIJS.  We could have done this deal alone but because of our position in this  country as civil servants, we are not allowed to operate a foreign account  and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the time of  transfer since we still work in this bank, this is the actual reason why  we required a second party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as  the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account or to set  up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this fund, even an empty a/c can  also serve for this purpose.  However, on smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to  25% as gratification for your assistance to us, while 5% will be set aside  to take care of expenses on both sides that may arise during the time of  transfer and also for telephone bills, and the remaining 70% will be for me  and my colleague.  What I want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin. I have  in my possession, all the necessary Documents to successfully accomplish  the operation. Bear in mind that this proposal is 100% risk free. Further  Information will be given to you as soon as I receive your positive  response. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your  wish. For confidentiality please contact me on my personal email  account:sulikuh_john@rediffmail.com and sulikuh_john@ourwest.com <mailto:sulikuh_john@ourwest.com>  Best Regards,  Mr. John Mensah Sulikuh  United Trust Bank Ltd ', 'GREETINGS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. Alternate email address: josemartinezguzman1940@yahoo.es  Dear friend, Greetings to you and your family! This mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignore it as unserious could come into your mind; but please consider it a divine wish and accept it with a deep sense of humility.  My name is Jose Martinez Guzman. I am a 65 years old man, I am Cuban currently residing in Madrid (Spain). I was formerly living in Cuba and served under Castro`s government but had to run into self exile after the ruling Government of Fidel Castro closed in on my family on accusations of anti-government statements, I was once married with two children but my family could not escape before the deadly hands of Castro`s goons fell on them.  l did made a lot of money serving Castro and on getting to Spain, I have been a merchant here in Madrid dealing in Ornamentals, Oriental Carpets and Artifacts and life was very smooth for me until about three(3) years ago when I was first diagnosed of Cancer of the Larynx. Before this happened my business and concern for making money was all I lived for, I never really cared about other values in life. But since the loss of my family and hometown, I have found a new desire to assist helpless families. I have been helping orphans in orphanage/motherless homes. I have once donated some money to orphans in war ravaged Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan and some East European Countries.  Before I became ill, I kept $US 5.5 Million in a long-term deposit vault of a bank and I didn`t state any next of kin when the money was deposited and if I died without stating any the money will automatically go into the coffers of the bank and I don`t want this to happen. I have left the hospital and presently receiving treatment in an acupuncture clinic, I have been undergoing treatment for Oesophageal Cancer at the hospital. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live.  It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations, because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them. Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me collect the deposit and distribute it amongst charity organizations and the incident that happened in Asia too.  Use your judgement to distribute the money and feel free to reimburse yourself when you have the money for any cost you incur during the process of collecting and distributing the money to charity organizations. I am going to send you vital documents to back my claims and I am willing to offer you a reward If you are willing to help, please reply as soon as you can on my alternate email address: josemartinezguzman1940@yahoo.es  Looking forward to hearing from you soonest.

Particularly, the Eco Bank International where the  deceased had an account valued at about Eighteen million  United States Dollars (US$18,000,000.00). The  management has issued me a notice to provide the next  of kin or have the account frozen within the next ten  official working days. Since I have been unsuccessful  in locating the relatives for over 2 years now I seek  your consent to present you as the next of kin of the  deceased since you have the same last name so that the  proceeds of this account valued at $18,000,000:00 can  be paid to you and then you and me can share the  money. 60% to me and 40% to you I have all the  necessary legal documents that can be used to back up  any claim we may make.  And this I must do to make sure that this fund is not  wasted or end up in the wrong hands. All I require is  your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal  through. I guarantee that this will be executed under  a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from  any breach of the law.

I am the above named person but now undergoing medical treatment now. I am married to Dr.Waltner De Matinez who worked with angolan embassy in mexico for over nine years before he died in the year 2002. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$27.6Million (twenty-seven million six hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with one finance/security company in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church or individual to that will use this to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of the lord is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don`t have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don`t want my husbands hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know  where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I dont need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health,and because of the presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the  Finance/Security Company Europe. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you. please reply me through my private email; Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.

I have donated some money to orphans in Sudan, South Africa, Cameroon, Brazil, Spain, Austria, Germany and some Asian countries. ! Before I became ill, I kept $15 Million in a long-term deposit account in a finance company . Presently, I?m in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for oesophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live. It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations.

Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me collect the deposit and the interest accrued from the company and distributes it amongst charity organizations.

Dear Friend,  I am Mr.Simon Wong, credit officer of Dah Sing Bank  Ltd, Hong Kong. I  have an urgent and  very  confidential business proposition for you.  On october 15, 1999, our client Mr. Hatem Kamil Abdul  Fatah who was the deputy governor of Baghdad in Iraq  and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit  for 12 calendar months, with a value of  Fourty  Millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars  only in my branch.  Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even  after the war late this year.   Another notification was sent and still no response  came from him.   We later find out that the Governor has been  assasinated in Baghdad.  The websites below is a verification of the news about  his death:  http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/1/hi/world/middle_east/3970619.stm  http://www.uslaboragainstwar.org/article.php?id=6979  After further investigation it was also discovered  that Mr. Hatem Kamil Abdul Fatah did not declare any  next of kin in his official papers including the paper  work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me  the last time he was at my office that no one except  me knew of his deposit in my bank.  According to the Hong Kong Law,under china's foreign  and defense affairs,at the expiration of 5 (five)  years,such funds will revert to the ownership of the  chinese Government for financing military  operations,such as purchasing of arms and ammunitions  for the military.  In order to avert this negative development,i will  like to seek for your permission as a foreigner to  stand as the next of kin to  Mr. Hatem Kamil Abdul  Fatah so that the fruits of this old man's labor will  not be use for financing weapons which will further  enhance the courses of war in the world in general.

Which is one of the main reasons it has been very important to locate his next of kin.  After the death of my client his bankers contacted me, as his Attorney to provide his next of kin who should inherit his fortune. The board of directors of his bank adopted a resolution and I was mandated to provide his next of kin for the payment of this money or forfeit the money to the bank as an abandoned Estate. The bankers had planned to invoke a clause in the property Act, to confiscate the funds after the expiration of a period given to me. It was while i was searching for his family records on the internet  that i came across your contact.I have searched through almost all the genealogy site that you can think of both in the  Russia,USA and all the possible places I thought my clients would have possibly had a family member. Despairing and at the point of desperation, I came across your name, while trying to locate documentation's regarding possible relatives of my client in his country of origin. Convinced that you may be able to act in locus for my late client as his next of kin, I therefore, decided to contact you with these facts before me because of the status quo. By virtue of my brief and my closeness to the deceased, I am very much aware of my client's financial standing and the bank account he operates here in my country. I have reasoned very professionally and I feel it will be legally proper to present you as the next of kin of my deceased client and the sole beneficiary of his estate, so that you are be paid the funds left in his bank account,  hence I contacted you. I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin; the bank needs only the facts as presented legally. The rest is between you and I and with my guide we can have the money paid into your account, once this is done we shall both share the funds. 50% to me and 40% to you, while 10% should be for Taxes as your Government may require, I shall assemble all the necessary Legal Documents that will be used to back up our claim. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through.  I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any Breach of law.

Dear Friend,   REQUEST FOR URGENT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP IN RESPECT OF THE TRANSFER OF $25,500,000.00(TWENTY-FIVE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED AMERICAN DOLLARS)INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.    I, on behalf of my other colleagues from different Federal Government of Nigeria owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as regards the transfer of the above stated amount into your bank account. This fund arose from the overinvoiced of various contracts awarded in my parastatal to certain foreign contractors sometime ago.     We as holders of sensitive positions in our various parastatal, were mandated by the federal government to scrutinise all payments made to foreign contractors, and discovered that some of the contracts they executed were grossly over invoiced, either by omission or commission. Also, we discovered that the sum of $33,000,000.00(thirty three million American dollars only) was lying in a suspense account, although the foreign contractors were fully paid their entitlements after executing the said contracts. We all agreed that the over-invoiced amount be transferred into a bank account provided by a foreign partner, as the code of conduct of federal civil service does not allow us to operate foreign accounts.      However, we have suceeded in transferring some of the monies, precisely US$7.5(Seven million five Hundred American Dollars) into a foreign account in Morocco (North Africa), but unfortunately the provider of the account has severed all forms of communication with us as he has refused to adhere to our earlier mutual agreement, insisting tha the total amount be paid into his nominated bank account before disbursement will take effect.       We are therefore seeking your assistance based on the balance amount US$25.5M which can be speedily processed and fullyremitted into your nominated bank account. On successful remittance of the funds into your account, you will be compensated with 20% of the amount for your assistance and services.       This transaction is closely knitted and in view of our sensitive positions we cannot afford a slip. I assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free.We will avail you with our identities as regards our respective office when relationship is fully established and smooth operation commences.        I am at your disposition to entertain any questions from you in respect of this transaction, so, contact me immediately through the above email address for further information on the requirements and procedure.        Please note that this is a DEAL and confidentiality is of very great importance for security reasons.        Please treat with strict confidenlity and utmost urgency.

I strongly regret any inconvenience the receipt of this letter may   cause you, bearing in mind the nature of its content coming from a   person without any referral, but please read and assimilate its content and objectively consider if we can work together.   I am the head of the account department of a Private Bank in the United Kingdom and I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you.   This involves a client who had an investment placed under our bank's management years ago, the circumstances surrounding the investment made by this client who died interstate, with no known nominated successor in title over this investment made with the Private Banking Branch of my bank has made it very difficult to locate anyone who is directly related to the deceased.   With the very strong feeling that no one will ever come forward to   claim the funds and the investigation coming to a close after several months, the need for an assistance becomes crucial, as a next of kin to the depositor is earnestly being searched for, I have already developed a foolproof, legal and totally risk free means through which the fund can be released to your nominated bank account within a very short time after due documentation and authentication process.   The strategy is to use my position and influence as the Head of the branch and Personal Account officer of the deceased to present you as a next of Kin and beneficiary of the deposit. I want to assure you that I have concluded all local modalities for the successful completion of this within 10 banking days of your agreement to proceed with me as the required assistance is perfected to be 100% risk free. Please reply me to enable us proceed.   I expect your urgent response and if in the affirmative, I shall advice you on what we need to do.  Best regards,   Frank Jones. ", 'Hello, Please Treat ASAP.

DEAR SIR/MADAM,  I am Mr. GABRIEL MEDEI, Bank Manager {Hillbrow Branch} of Amalgamated Bank Of South Africa {ABSA}. I got your email contact, in my search for a trusted partner, who will assist me with this confidential business proposal.  Mr. Stev  Jam made a numbered times (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000.00 (twethy- five Million US Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, National Mining Corporation that Mr. Stev Jam died from an auto accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Stev Jam did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$25 M  is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at every end of   each year. No one has come forward to claim it. According to the South African Law, at the expiration of 6{Six} years, the money will devert to the ownership of the South African Government ,if nobody applies to claim the funds.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Stev Jam  so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.                                                                 ;          This is simple   ( 1)  I shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and obtaining the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.  (2) A bank account in any part of the world, which you provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin of Mr. Stev  Jam.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 35%[US$8,750,000:00 DOLLARS] for you then 5% will be set aside for any expenses that may occur during the transfer process. There is no risk at all as the attorney and my position will do all the paperwork for this transaction as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address.  Upon your response shall then provide you with more details for the successful accomplishment of this transaction.

I am writing you to solicit your assistance in a business partnership that could be of mutual benefit to both of us. I hope that you read thoroughly and response as promptly as possible. Precisely, in the year 2000, the Ministry of Minerals and Energy in South Africa where I work as a Manager of 14 Project Allocation, received presidential irrevocable circular order requesting the ministry to compile and forward the list of all past foreign contractors, whose contract payments are pending since the period of the past government of Dr, Nelson Mandela and the present government. The purpose of this presidential order is that the present South Africa elected government will pay foreign contractors all debts owned, and thus maintaining a good relationship with other foreign government and non-governmental financial agencies. In light of the above, my partner and I duty is to compile a list of these contractors. We have decided to include a company name with a bill of {USD25 Million United State Dollars} along side other company names and their respective bill for payments. The {Alliance Mining SA PTY}, which was incorporated for this operation, also carried out contractual works for the ministries as well as others. With the co-operation of top senior partner of mine we are confident that our claim of {USD25Million} shall be granted being for contract work executed at the Ministry of Minerals and Energy, payment shall then be transferred upon approval to a safe account that would be provided by you in other words, if you accept to be our partner then you shall be considered given the pertinent documentation to certify that your company had been awarded a contract already executed, for which your company shall be paid the sum of USD25Million. Please be informed that with the South Africa government monetary policy. Government official's employees are not allowed to operate or to own bank account abroad hence our decision to seek a foreign partner. However, the legitimacy of this transaction is well pronounced, which I will personally explain to you by fax or telephone if you agree to be our partner to determine your true position. I have the authority and consent of my partner to offer this transaction to you. You will be highly compensated with a percentage upon mutual agreement by both parties after a successful completion of this project. Further information concerning the transaction shall be forwarded to you upon your response to this letter. I can assure you that my partners and I are in a position to make this payment claim possible, provided you can give us the assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured. Visualize this opportunity as an indirect financial resource; also note that your area of specialization is not a hindrance in the successful execution of this transaction, endeavour to contact me immediately by the above alternative email address because we will not compromise this transaction with any form of exposure, as we are still in active civil service. Please keep this close to your chest as much as possible; we can not afford any political problems. Thank you and God bless, as I await for a long term mutually beneficially relationship for both of us. Yours Faithfully Dr Abraham Maliba.   ", "STAND AS THE NEXT OF KIN TO MY LATE CLIENT...?

I have contacted  you to assist in retrieving the sum of US$10m deposited in a security  company by my client before it get'sconfisicated because the security  company doesn't know that the content of the consignment is cash because on  the day of deposite we declared it as family valuables because we never want  them to know the true content of the consignment. The security company has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or  have the consignment confisicated within the next two weeks and these very  money is too  big for me to allow it to beconfisicated by the authority.  Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over 2  years now I seek your consent to  present you as the next of kin of the  deceased since you have the same last name so that the proceeds of this  consignment valued at 10million dollars can be released to you and then you  and me can share the money. 60% to me and 40% to you I have all necessary  legal documents that can be used to back the claim. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through.  I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that  will protect you from any breach of the law.

After going through the proposal and under standing it very  well and you are willing to do this transaction with me,get back to me  immediately so that we can start as follows: 1)I will send to you the contact of the security company,the deposite code,  for you to call for verification if such deposite is really existing. 2)The claim will require both of our physical presentation at the security  company. With constant communication it will not take us more than seven  working days to achieve our aim. It is a promise that at the end of the day you will embrace me and we will  become one family friends for life as I was with my late client.

It has defied all forms of medical treatment, and  right now I have only about a few months to live,  according to medical experts.I have not particularly  lived my life so well, as I never really cared for  anyone(not even myself)but my business. Though I am  very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile  to people and only focused on my business as that was  the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this  as I now know that there is more to life than just  wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I  believe when God gives me a second chance to come to  this world I would live my life a different way from  how I have lived it.  Now that God has called me, I have willed and given  most of my property and assets to my immediate and  extended family members as well as a few close  friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my  soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity  organizations, as I want this to be one of the last  good deeds I do on earth.  So far, I have distributed money to some charity  organizations in the U.A.E, Somalia and Malaysia.  Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot  do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my  family to close one of my accounts and distribute the  money which I have there to charity organization in  Bulgaria and Rwanda, they refused and kept the money  to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as  they seem not to be contended with what I have left  for them.  The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge  cash deposit of Twenty Eight Million USD that I have  with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want  you to help me collect this deposit and despatch it to  charity organizations.  I have set aside 20% for you and for your time.  Please reply to my personal e.mail address ellisd@katamail.com  God be with you.  DAVID ELLIS ', "WITH DUE RESPECT FROM DR/BARRISTER KAM IBRAHIM  SENIOR ADVOCATE OF BURKINA FASO (ESQ)  WEST AFRICA.

BECAUSE THE BANKING LAW AND GUIDELINES HERE STIPULATED THAT IF SUCH MONEY REMAINED UNCLAIMED AFTER FIVE (5) YEARS THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFERRED INTO THE BANK TREASURY AS AN UNCLAIMED FUND.  THE REQUEST OF FOREIGNER AS NEXT OF KIN IN THIS BUSINESS IS OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS A FOREIGNER AND A BURKINABE CANNOT STAND AS NEXT OF KIN TO A FOREIGNER. AFTER ALL THESE, I DECIDED TO TRACE HIS RELATIVES OVER THE INTERNET AND ALSO TRAVELLED TO GERMANY, TO LOCATE ANY MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY BUT OF NO AVAIL, HENCE I CONTACTED YOU TO ASSIST ME IN REPATRIATING THE BALANCE OF LATE MR. JOHN KOROVO LEFT BEHIND TO YOU AS HIS REAL NEXT OF KIN.

THEREFORE TO ENABLE THE IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF THE FUND TO YOU AS INDICATED, YOU MUST APPLY FIRST TO THE BANK AS HIS NEXT OF KIN, INDICATING YOUR BANK INFORMATION WHERE THE  MONEY WILL BE REMITTED.      IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO NOTE THAT I HAVE ALL NECESSARY LEGAL DOCUMENTS THAT CAN BE USED TO BACKUP THE CLAIM, ALL I REQUIRE IS YOUR HONEST COOPERATION TO ENABLE US SEEING THIS DEAL THROUGH.  I GUARANTEE THAT THIS WILL BE EXECUTED UNDER A LEGITIMATE ARRANGEMENT THAT WILL PROTECT YOU AND ME FROM ANY BREACH OF THE LAW.

Dear friend, Greetings, I am Mr.Henry Okoye the Account Manager of Late Mr.  Morris  Thompson in Standard Trust Bank Regional Office in Victoria island, here  in Lagos.However I got your contact through the International web  directory.I decided to contact you by email because I feel that it is  more secured and private. Recently we discovered a Dormant Account with a huge amount of Money  Valued USD35,000,000.00 (Thirty Five Million Dollars only)that belongs to  one of our late Customer who died in a plane crash .During our  investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very  huge sum of money belonging to Late Mr.  Morris Thompson an American  great  industrialist and a resident of Alaska, who  unfortunately lost  his life in the plane  crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed  on January 31  2000,including his wife and only daughter.  You shall read more news about the crash on  visiting this site which I  got during my  investigation; http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/ and http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html The fund has been dormant in his account With this Bank without any claim  of the funds in our custody either from his family or relation before our  discovery of this development. The Banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for  five years, it will be for feited no the Bank treasury as an unclaimed  bill.It is only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and It is  upon this discovery that I decided to contact you to collaborate with you  to pull out this dormant fund. In order to avert this negative  development, I on behalf of my trusted colleagues now seek your  permission to have you stand in as next of kin to Our late Customer so  that the fund will be released and paid into your account as the  beneficiary.s next of kin now that the bank is still expecting a next of  kin or relative of the deceased ,Late Mr.  Morris Thompson. In fact we could have done this deal alone but because of our position in  this country as civil servants, we are not allowed to operate a foreign  account and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during  the time of transfer since we still work in this bank,this is the actual  reason why we required a second party or fellow who will assist us  forward claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing  bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this fund, even an empty a/c can also serve for this purpose. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% as  gratification for your assisting us, and the remaining 60% will be for me  and my partners. What I want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin. I  have in my possession, all the necessary Documents to successfully  accomplish the operation. Bear in mind that this proposal is 100% risk  free. Further Information will be given to you as soon as I receive your  positive response.

We are an independent financial institution with most secure operation in keeping financial deposits from any sort of fraud, theft or laundering investigation. Our regulated position has attracted all manner of clientele to our organisation including heads of various governments, top-level executives,etc.  One of our clients, DR. ROBERT DIMITRIS, who was before his death, was an adviser to the Organisation of Petroleum Export Country (OPEC), had over fifty Million pounds lodged with us. On his death five years ago, his heir (his wife) put a claim for his money and my company paid off in line with her request. However,his wife did not know that the facts of Nine million, eight hundred thousand British Pounds (GBP3.8 Million)paid in by DR.ROBERT DIMITRIS in a different account and the money is still lying with us.  I therefore made further investigations and discovered that DR. ROBERT DIMITRIS did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank deposit paperwork in my Financial Institution.This sum of GBP3.8 million is still in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one has and will ever come forward to claim it. According to British law, at the expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Based on my position in this company, I have kept the facts of this case and a few others I am  still watching closely to myself alone.The reason I have decided to contact you is because I am quite certain I can move these funds out immediately but would need your assistance.  What this requires is that you put in an application with a letter of probate, which I will forward to you. This will enable us to open a premium account with my Financial Institution and I will simply make an internal database transfer of the Funds to your account. Once this is done and you will see your new balance, you will put in a claim to have your money.However, due to the fact that my company would not entertain your request to open an account without a proof of the fund origin,  I have without divulging secured the copy of the deposit document of the said fund and will forward it to you when I have your interest in my proposal. On grounds that you agree to do this with me, the money will be shared in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. However, it is quite necessary that these are kept as confidential as possible for its successive completion within days. Please contact me and I will take it from there. Once I hear from you,I will give you access to view DR.ROBERT DIMITRIS account details and you can check  his account statement via the bank s online services to certify what am saying.

", "YOURS IN CHRIST Dearly Beloved in Christ, It is by the grace of God that I received Christ,Having known the truth, I had no choice than to do what  is lawful and right in the sight of God for eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God´s mercy and glory upon my life.I am Mrs Luisa Raymond the wife of Mr George Raymond, my husband worked with the  Chevron/Texaco in Kenya for twenty years before he died in the year 2001.We were married for  twenty-seven years without a child. My Husband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days.  Before his death we were both born again Christians.  Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is  against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US $10.5M. (Ten million Five Hundred Thousand  U.S. Dollars) with a Bank in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the Bank and the management just wrote me  as the beneficiary to come forward to sign for the release of this money or rather issue a letter of authorization to  somebody to receive it on my behalf if I can not come over. Presently, I'm in a hospital in Kenya where I have been undergoing treatment for esophageal cancer.  I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live.  It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations any where in the World.  Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with  the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them. Please, I beg you in the name of God to  help me Stand and collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God fearing that will use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows  propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to  understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that  will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard  earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an  ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know  where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord.  Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any  telephone communication in this regard because of my soundless voice and presence of my husband's  relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are  possible.  As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of Attorney who is in Europe as he will be  the one to assist you in laying claims for this funds.

Barrister  Victor told me that the manager then was very sick during their company�s  liquidation and later died and for that reason no one raised the issue of  their Surrender value with our insurance company. If you accept to stand as the manager or an Assistant manager of the  liquidated Company to claim this surrender value of Twelve million dollars,  I am willing to split the funds into three parts, for each of us having an  equal share of Four Million Dollar. Once you file the claim, we will do the  rest for you in the inside and get the payment released in your name. If you  are interested and capable please get back to me through email. I will send my identifications to you once you indicate your interest to  work with me. There is no risky in your involved because the company has  been liquidated and dissolved and has left Africa for about eight years.This  Barrister Victor and I will come over to your country for our share once  this transaction is concluded. I am optimistic that we will conclude this  transaction within three weeks. Thanks in advance for your anticipated co-operation Regards Mr.Tony Silver', 'Ken Quattara. Mr.Ken Quattara.  Ghana.  Good day to you!  I am requesting for your assistance in a deal of Considerable  financial gain for both of us.  I am Ken Quattara, I was the Personal Assistant (P.A) to the former  President of The Federal Republic of Togo, the late President  Gnassingbe Eyadema.  In the last week of January 2005, two security deposit boxes were  deposited on behalf of Mr. Eyadema by me with a company in Ghana.  The boxes contained 35 million dollars in cash. I have the  certificate of deposit issued by the company for the boxes. As his  trusted P.A I had employed the services of this particular company  to arrange the shipment of the boxes to Europe on his behalf were  they were to be picked up by a foreign associate of his at that  time, a French man.  This was not the first time I had arranged this kind of shipment for  Mr.Eyadema using this company. The boxes were labeled "photographic  materials" to elude customs and other checks.  Unfortunately, because he was ill-disposed at the time the French  man was no longer able to make the trip to meet with the company\'s  agents at the destination point. So the agents who accompanied the  boxes had to deposit them in a storage facility pending when he  could come.  On the 5th of February 2005, Mr Eyadema passed on while he was being  evacuated abroad for emergency medical treatment. He had been ill  for some years.  Following the demise of my former Boss, his associate withdrew, so  the boxes have been in storage since then. It was my function to  issue his associates Letters Of Athorization signed by me to pick up  boxes containing valuables and money. They banked money for him in  various pre-selected banks in Europe and Asia. The agents only  assisted the associates in the process to ensure that everything was  done under diplomatic immunity and within the stipulated laws in the  countries where such transactions took place.  I am asking for your assistance and involvement so that we can get  the money for ourselves. I can not do this on my own because i can\'t  so to say, authorize myself. If you accept to act as an associate of  the Late Mr Eyadema, I can issue to you the Letter of Authorization  for the purpose of reclaiming the boxes on his behalf for our own  benefit. As the beneficiary it will be your responsibility and  obligation (as stated in the coded agreement between the depositor  and the company) to reclaim and repossess the boxes from the storage  facility.  You will be required to meet with the company\'s assigned agent(s)  personally.  This way you will see the boxes for yourself and sign the necessary  documents to reposses the boxes. The agent(s) will assist you to  bank the funds and then thereafter you can transfer money to other  offshore accounts. This was how itwas done with previous associates.   Or you may choose to arrange something else with the agent(s). If  however you can not meet with any assigned agent, as the  beneficiary/associate to the Late Eyadema,you could request that an  alternative arrangement be made for you. You will have to discuss  this with the agent(s) yourself.  I assure you that everything will go smoothly if you choose to  cooperate with the agent(s). There is no illegality involved here.  If you do decide to get involved then i expect total commitment from  you. If you can do this, i am offering you 3 million dollars as your  own share.  If you are interested in this deal, then contact me immediately via  email(furnished above) for further details. Thank you for your time.  Regards,  Ken Quattara ', 'Ken Quattara. Mr.Ken Quattara.

I  have an urgent  and  very confidential business proposition for you.  On october 15, 1999, our client Mr. Hatem Kamil Abdul  Fatah who was the deputy governor of Baghdad in Iraq  and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit  for 12 calendar months, with a value of  Fourty  Millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars  only in my branch.  Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even  after the war late this year.  Another notification  was sent and still no response  came from him. We later find out that the Governor has  been  assasinated in Baghdad.  The websites below is a verification of the news about  his death:  http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/1/hi/world/middle_east/3970619.stm  http://www.uslaboragainstwar.org/article.php?id=6979  After further investigation it was also discovered  that Mr. Hatem Kamil Abdul Fatah did not declare any  next of kin in his official papers including the paper  work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in  me,last time he was at my office that no one except  me knew of his deposit in my bank.  According to the ghana Law,under ecowas's foreign and  defense affairs,at the expiration of 5 (five)  years,such funds will revert to the ownership of the  ghanian Government for financing military  operations,such as purchasing of arms and ammunitions  for the military.  In order to avert this negative development,i will  like to seek for your permission as a foreigner to  stand as the next of kin to  Mr. Hatem Kamil Abdul  Fatah so that the fruits of this old man's labor will  not be use for financing weapons which will further  enhance the courses of war in the world in general.  The money will be paid into your account for us to  share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and  10% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the  transaction.There is no risk at all as all the  paperwork  for this transaction will be done by my  attorney and with my position as the credit officer  guarantees the successful execution of this  transaction.

I am contacting you for a mutual business relationship  and for you to act as my guardian in a joint business  venture that we will operate together.  After praying, my mind asked me to go ahead and  contact you for this partnership.  My name is PRINCE HASSAN SULEMAN, the only son of  Late ALHAJI USMAN SULEMAN. My mother died on the  22nd of October, 1985 of cancer and my father was  assassinated on the 28th of April 2003 by an unknown  person in Abidjan, Cote dIvoire.  My father was a gold and cocoa merchant based in  Ghana/Cote dIvoire.Breifly before he died in a  hospital here in Abidjan, Cote dIvoire due to  injuries he sustained from the gunshots. He told me  about the sum of US$45M(Forty Five Million United States  Dollars) belonging to him in a suspense account with  one of our local Bank here in Abidjan, Cote dIvoire.  That he willed the money to me in his will, with his  attorney. He asked me to seek for a foreign partner  Who will assist me in transferring the money out of  Abidjan, CotedIvoire to a foreign account for  investment purpose. Then help me make arrangement  after the transfer to leave this country. That those  people that killed him may be after me.  According to my late fathers will, the money cannot  be released to me without a foreign partner until at  the age of 37 years. It can only be transferred from  the Bank here to the account of my foreign partner  before I attain the age of 37 years. Presently I am  34years old and can not seat here for the next 3years  waiting for the maturity date, while my life is in  danger. This is my reason for contacting you to assist  me present your self as my foreign partner and also  provide foreign account where this fund will be  transferred to.I have already contacted my fathers  attorney here in respect of this transaction. He is  waiting to hear from my foreign partner for us to  start the process for the transfer of the funds.  I would have done this since but according to our  tradition. I have to wait till its one year after my  fathers death as a mark of respect before embarking  on such project. So that it will not look like if I am  just after his money like my uncle. Since the death of  my father, I have been with my fathers brother in  Ghana. Honestly the way he is treating me, make me  to be suspecting him that he knows some thing about my  late fathers death.  Based on this, I left his house with out his consent.  Presently I am in Abidjan,Cote d Ivoire. He dont  know my way about and will never know. This is why I  need your assistance so urgent for us to finalise this  transaction as soon as possible for me to leave this  Country.

Dear Beloved One, With the hope that you are okay and doing fine, l am contacting you for business transaction.  This proposal could be strange but please give it some attention.  I got your contact details on the internet and i decieded to  contact you first in  good faith.  My name is PHILIP DESMOND, I live in Ivory Coast in West Africa.  I have inherited the sum of USD$27,000,000.00 (Twenty seven million Dollars) from my late parents.  But l am faced with a problem.  It is in respect of this problem that l am contacting you. On the banks documents for the next of kin, my late father appended a clause stating that:  I the next of kin, must attain the age of 35 years, before taking full control of the bank account, But, in the event of war or natural  disasters in Ivory Coast, the bank should honour a transfer request from me which must be for the safety of the funds, And in this case, I must have an investment manager, my investment manager must not be from this country that my investment manager most be a foreigner.   I am only 24 years old now, but Ivory Coast is not a safe country at this time because of the war and the political crisis.  So I want the bank to transfer my money out of Ivory Coast to your account in any  safe country, but the bank is insisting that l fulfil the conditions put down by my late father.   This is actually the reason why l am writing you.   So please I would like you to become my investment manager, because having an investment manager is the condition the bank insist l have to meet before they would agree to transfer my money out to any account.  When you become my investment manager, l would instruct the bank to transfer my money to your account in your country, so that you can help me invest the money wisely while me and my small sister will further our education in your country.  And please tell me what we can invest with this money in your country?  Please I am expecting your response.  If you wish to reply me,Please reach me at this same email address . I am willing to give you 20% of the total money for your assistance.  And please reply with your full contact information for easy communications so that i can send details and the deposit documents to you for better clearifications with the bank contact. My regards, PHILIP DESMOND', 'Please reply Mrs.Grace Omar Dakar Rep.of Senegal West Africa.  Dear Beloved One.  Thank you for giving me your time;Please be patient and read my email to you, this letter might come as a surprise to you,and you could be wondering where I got your contact.  I got your address through a personal search on the internet for someone relaible and trustworthy,so i decided to contact you for an assistant, which I do hope you will take your time to consider.   I am a widow  to the late principal accountant of Sierra Leon central bank who was assassinated due to political hostility in my country.  For the sake of our lives,my children and i fled to a neighbouring country, Senegal; where we are now seeking refuge.  I must confess to you,our journey to Senegal was not a jolly ride as we encountered a lot of problems,most painful was a particular situation that left us in a state of penury and where we also lost our travelling documents,thereby making  it impossible for us to travel now.  Months ago i was diagnosed with cancer,this futher made our lives more difficult as i am lacking funds to take care of my self and my children.  I decided to contact you,seeking your assistance because i am having problems recovering a large deposit made by my late husband overseas since the company maintained that instructions left by my late husband the original depositor,states that the funds be "RELEASED TO ME HIS WIFE OR A FOREIGN REPRESENTATIVE ONLY", believing he would appoint someone by himself to represent him for the claim but unfortunately he died earlier.  This is the only hope my family has of surviving,paticularly my only son,who has so much dreams and i want to do the best i can to help them fufill thier dreams.  I am contacting you to help me make the claims by representing my husband as the foreign representative,since i cannot travel to make the claims my self due to my present condition,i am pleading with you to help us claim the funds from the security firm and most importantly, your ability to put the said funds into circulation wisely for our joint interest and relocating my children particularly my son is a major considerable factor regarding my request as my knowledge on financial matters is not enough to handle such amount of fund(us$16,000,000.00)  sixteen million dollars.  In view of this, if you are touched to work with me in sincerity, by standing as my late husband,s foreign representative to receive the said deposit on our behalf, we shall embrace you as our family and will compensate you accordingly.  I am willing to share the money 40% for you,40% for me and my children and the remaining 10% we be set aside for any expenses that may be incurred in the course of this transaction,all i really care about now is the welfare of my children.  As you indicate interest, please contact my son ANTA OMAR on this email address (an_omar07@yahoo.fr)or call him on his phone number Tel:  +221-4488469  to enable him give you further information relating to the funds and the steps we shall take to finalize on the project,i have handed this project to him as my health conditions makes it hard for me to talk or go around.  Thanking you in advance for your kind and urgent response, more so for keeping our proposal to your self. Sincerely Grace Omar.', 'FROM MR ABDUL LAWAL (HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU) FROM MR ABDUL LAWAL STANDARD TRUST BANK OF BENIN REPUBLIC OF BENIN. WEST AFRICA. DEAR FRIEND, I am MR.ABDUL LAWAL,the director in charge of auditing and accounting section of standard trust Bank of Benin republic in West Africa with due respect and regard. i have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on 30th january 2000 on Kenya Airways with aircraft Airbus 310-304 at location Abidjan, Ivory Coast, with registration number 5Y-BE while travelling with his entire family, his wife, two children and a maid on a festive visit to Abidjan and since his untimely death the funds has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our ustody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development. Although personally, I kept this information secret within myself and partners to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amount was USD$24.1M (twenty four Million one Hundred Thousand united states dollars). may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through my good friend who works with chamber of commerce on foreign business relations here in Cotonou-Benin, it is him who recommended your person to me to be viable and capable to champion a business of such magnitude without any problem. Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased and get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place, all directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit yourself to this great business opportunity.In fact i could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant, we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because i work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designated bank account. May i at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as i have made all arrangements for a successful transaction as an insider of the bank before contacting you.On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of any expenses that may arise during the time of transfer like telephone bills, fax and our travel tickets to come over to your country for the sharing of the fund while 60% will be for me and my partners. Please you have been advised to keep this a top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment either in your country or any country you will advice us to invest in.All other necessary information will be sent to you on your acceptance to champion this transaction with me.I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible in this deal.

After the death of my father, my mother and I with my younger sister  decided to move out of Zimbabwe for the safety of our lives.  Before we moved, we were able to, with the assistance of a diplomat friend of  my late father send the money> my father kept in the safe in my mother's house,  which amounted to the sum of US$24.7 Million United States Dollars to Overseas. The diplomat, my father?s friend assited us in sending the money via Diplomatic  courier. The funds are presently being kept away in the secret vaults of a private  security firm based in overseas  The officials of the firm are also not aware of the contents of the package  and are of the belief that they are helping me in keeping my personal Valuables,  because> of the way I packaged the consignment as family  valuables.  Myself and my mother then decided to contact any reliable overseas Partner who  could assist us to collect and transfer this money out of the Security company  to a safe account nominated by such a person, because we as asylum seekers here  in South Africa we are handicapped in doing this because our status here  does not permit us to a lot of facilities.  If my proposition is considered, for assisting us in this transaction, we intend to  share funds in the ratio of 75% for me and my family, 20% for you then 5%  will be set aside to cover any expenses incurred during this transaction.  There is no risk at all, as all the documents for the success of this transaction I  will forward to you.

I am the only daugther of Late General Frank Donald the former Director of military inteligence and special acting General Manager of the Sieria Leone Diamond mining coperation(SLDMC ). I am contacting you to seek your good assistance to transfer and invest (USD 10. million) belonging to my late father which is deposited in a bank in Abidjan. This money is revenues from solid minirals and dimonds sale which were under my fathers possession before the civil war broke out. Following the brake out of the war, almost all government offices, coperations and parastatals were attacked and vandalized.  The SLDMC was loothed and burnt down to ashes, and diamonds worth millions of dollars was stolen by the rebel military forces who attacked my fathers office. Many top government officials and senior army officers were assasinated and my father was a key target because of his very sensitive military possition and appointment in the SLDMC.  Regreatably, my father was captured and murdered along with half brother in cool blood during a mid-night rebel shoot-out when our official residence in freetown was armbushed by Fordey Sanko the notorious rebel leader. My mother sustainded very sever bullet injuries which resulted to her untimelyand painful death in a private hospital here in Ivory Coast. Now I am alone in a totally strange country without parents, relatives or any body to care for me at my tender ages.  Before my mother died, she told me that my father deposited some money which he made from diamond sales and contracts at this bank here in Ivory Coast and that i should pray and find a trustworthy foreign business partner who would help me to transfer and invest this money in profitable business venture overseas. She told me to do this quickly so that i can leave Ivory Coast with my cousin brother-Arthur who is here in the camp with me and, then settle down abroad.  She gave to me all the bank documents to prove the deposit and then told me that my father used my name as the only daugther to deposit the money in the bank. She told me that this is the reason why we came to Ivory Coast. My mother died afterwards. May her soul rest in perfect peace.  I have gone to the bank to make inquires about this money and I spoke with the director of International remittance who assured me that the everything is intact and promised to help me transfer this money to my foreign partners bank account as soon as I provide my partners foreign bank account for them. However, the director is very concerned because of my age, I am 23 years and as such promised to help me and he would like to speak with my partner to ensure that this money is invested wisely in only profitable business because of his personal interest and sympathy for me.  If you are will to assist me, please let me know immediately and provide me with your following information for bank here: 1. Your full names and address, tel/ fax 2.

I am interested in any profitable commercial venture which you consider very good in your country and you would also get a school for me and cousin so that we can finish our colledge education.  I am hoping to hear your urgent response so that I can not look for another foreign partner. Thank you and may God bless you and your dear family. Yours sincerely Nena Donald.

This fund belongs to Mr. Robbin Marvin, Inview of the above we are working as the International Monitoring Committee here in the West Africa, and we monitor every out going and incoming huge fund that was leaving every bank from the West African States to any destination in the whole world. And this organization was empowered by the USA Government (NDLEA) National Drug Law Enforcement Agency after (911) September 11 2001 bomb blast in United State of America, to make sure that every fund that was leaving the West African region has no relationship with Anti Drug Law or Terrorism.  This sum of $17.8 M USD (Seventeen Million Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) is still in our correspondent Bank where it was held prior for transfer after the investigation before the report came to us that he died, and since then no one has come forward to claim it since the report of his sudden death. Mr Robbin Marvin of United States of America's fund has proved legitimate. According to the rules and stipulation of the organization of WEACA at the expiration of 7 (seven) weeks from now, the money will be re-called back to the Central Bank of Senegal if nobody applies to claim the funds as a cousin or beneficiary next of kin to Mr Robbin. Based on my position in this organization, I have kept the facts of this case I am still watching closely to myself alone.The reason I have decided to contact you is because I am quite certain I can move these funds out immediately but would need your assistance. What this requires is that you put in an application of claim into this fund with my guide line. This will enable the Bank where the money was held to open a premium account and make an internal database transfer of the Funds to your account.  However, in the fact that our European Bank may not entertain your request to open an account without a proof of the fund origin, I will without divulging forward to you the whole documents of the said fund and will forward it to you when I have your interest in this matter, On grounds that you agree to do this with me, the money will be shared in the ratio of 60% for me and the chief executive and protocol officer of WAECA who is the only peoples that knows the fact and origin of this fund then 40% for you. It is quite necessary that these are kept as confidential as possible for its successive completion. Please contact me and I will take it from there.

I decided to contact you after a careful thought that you may  be capable of handling this business transaction which i explained below; In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $10.5m US dollars (Ten  million, five hundred thousand US dollars). In an account that belongs to  one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in 1998 in  a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been  expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot  release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the  deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt  that his supposed next of kin(his son and wife) died alongside with him at  the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim . It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my  department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the  money to you as the next of kin (We want to present you as his busines  asociate )to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since  nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the Bank  treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  Unclaimed after seven years, the money will be transferred into the Bank  treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this  business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a  Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner .We agree that 30% of  this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision  of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incurred during  the business and 60% would be for me and my colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement  according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate  transfer of this fund to your account as arranged,you must apply first to  the bank as next of kin of the deceased customer. Upon receipt of your  reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I  will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free  and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required  arrangements have been made for the transfer. I expect that you contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Hoping to hear from you immediately.

Steve Moore(col.)  Osnabrueck,Germany  Attention Pls.,  IN DESPERATE NEED OF YOUR CO-OPERATION!  I write you this letter from Detention to solicit your help, as I am in dire need of your co-operation in this urgent matter.  I am Steve Moore, a Colonel in The Coalition Army(country detail will be given after introduction and proper establishment  of trust) deployed to Iraq in the wake of the change of the Sadam Hussein Regime in Iraq. I served there until I was  arrested and detained in connection with the Iraqi prisoner abuse scandal in 2004. I was previously attached to a Military  Base in Osnabrueck,Germany before my deployment to Iraq. I am presently at a detention facility in Osnabrueck,Germany.  In the course of my stay in Iraq,I have withnessed so much looting from which many colleagues have benefited in excess  of some millions of Dollars. After a long hesitation, I decided to grab the opportunity that God had given me by placeing me  in charge of the Security of all the recovered money.  This is a part of the money that the regime of Sadam Hussein,their friends and cronies had stolen and hidden in various parts  of Iraq before the war.It became the responsibility of the Allied soldiers to search for,recover this money and plough it back  into the governance of Iraq. In the proccess of securing the money running into hundreds of millions of US Dollars,we were  able to keep some away for ourselves. Thats how the money came about.  Everything went well until I was accused in 2004 alongside other colleagues suspected to have abused inmates of prisons  under the control of Allied Forces in Iraq.  I initially thought that my stay in prison awaiting trial would be brief but I have spent some time here without any change in  my hopeless situation! Now that I dont know how long I would stay here,and faced with the possibility of dismissal from the  Army if I am found guilty,I have come to accept that it is only proper to try and make some kind of reliable contact who could  help me pick up and safe-keep this money so that I dont lose everything I have saved during my stay in Iraq.Who knows;such  an opportunity,they say, comes once in a lifetime!  I just need a guarantee of trust from you because there have been cases of breach of trust in the past by contacts that some  of my colleagues have fronted for such transactions.I have presently,the sum of US$41.7m already shipped to safety somewhere  in Europe. I only need you to guarantie me that I can still get this money back,if it is remitted to you. I need a person I can trust  to safeguard this money since it is not possible to leave here and do it myself. All the arragerment to guarantee you a safe  access to the money has been made by me before my arrest.Your only part is to receive and safeguard it. We would further  discuss on how the money should be disbursed afterwards.  For your role in this business,I wish to compensate you handsomely on successful conclussion of this assignment.I must only  not forget to tell you that confidentiality in this business is very important to both parties.  I did not include my phone contact because any phone contact is for the military prison and therefore,not safe.This e-mail  address is the only reliable private contact I have here for now.I also have the right to occassional access to phone and internet  for recreational purposes though the chances are limited.I implore you to consider this proposal as urgently as possible and give  me a feedback so that we can expedite action in good time. If you are in favour of my proposal,please,do include your private  contact information - phone,email address to facilitate a more effective and confidential communication.I implore you to ponder  over this proposal as urgently as possible and get back to me.  Do not forget to pray fervently for my acquitance.I wish you the best as  I await your reply.  Thanks,  Best Regards,  Steve Moore(Col). ', "BUSINESS PROPOSAL (ASSISTANCE REQUIRED) BANK OF AMERICA (ASIA)LTD. 17/F DEVCON HOUSE 979 KING'S ROAD HONG KONG. Dear Friend, I am Joseph Wong, credit officer of Bank of America (Asia) Ltd, Hong Kong. I  have an urgent and  very confidential business proposition for you. On october 6, 2001, an American Engineer/Consultant with  the Chinese Solid  Minerals Corporation,Mr. Steinmetz Horst made a (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$40,500,000.00 (Forty Million  Five Hundred thousand United State Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity,I sent a routine  notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we  sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the  Hong Kong Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr. Steinmetz Horst died from a recurrent heart disease. On further investigation,I found out that he died  without making  a will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was  fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that  Mr. Steinmetz Horst did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his  official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$40,500,000.00 is still lingering in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the Hong Kong Law,under china's foreign and defense affairs,at the expiration of 5 (five) years,such funds will revert to the ownership of the chinese Government for financing military operations,such as purchasing of arms and ammunitions for the military. In order to avert this negative development,i will like to seek for your permission as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Steinmetz Horst so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not be use for financing weapons which will further enhance the courses of war in the world in general. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and 10% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the transaction.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork  for this project will be done by my attorney and with my position as the credit officer guarantees the successful execution of this project. If you are interested,please reply immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more  details and that will help you understand the transaction. You should observe utmost confidentiality,and rest assured  that this  project would be most profitable for both parties because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Thanks and regards. Mr. Joseph Wong.", "FROM MR ERIC KOSHY. FROM MR ERIC KOSHY. Email/erickoshy11@yahoo.fr Dearest friend,  Trust and Confidential Business Proposal.

Upon expiration of the period of   leasehold of his safety deposit vault two years ago, my client sent a   routine notification to   his forwarding address but got no reply.  Some months ago, a reminder was sent and finally it was discovered he   had passed away. On further investigation, it was discovered that he   did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were   fruitless. Further investigations revealed that Mr. CHOW LIU did not   declare   any next-of- kin in all his official documents in my clients' bank.   This sum of £17,500,000.00 is still in the Vault which was opened and   the keys changed upon the expiration of the period of leaseholdby   myclients.  Consequently, my proposal is that myclients will like you   as a   foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. CHOW LIU.   This is simple. I will like you to provide me immediately with your   full names and address so that by virtue of my position as an attorney,   I will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put   you in place as the next of kin.  I shall do the drafting and   notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter   of probate/administration in your favor form the shipment of the funds   through a courrier company to you. The money will be shipped by courier   to you for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and my clients and   20% for you.   I hope that is okay.  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for   this transaction will be done by me as an attorney and the position of   my client as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of   this transaction. If you areinterested, please reply immediately via   email:- brian_smith650@hotmail.com  If on the other hand you are not   interested please disregard this mail and I will not contact you   again.

DEAR FRIEND   I am MR ABDUL LAZEEZ, the director in charge of auditing and accounting section of Standard trust bank of Benin cotonou Republic of Benin in West Africa with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction .  During our investigation and auditing in this bank,my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in (beirut-bound charter jet) plane crash on the 25th December 2003 here in cotonou (replublic of benin) and since his untimely death the funds has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got during my investigation; (http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/index.html).  Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself and partners to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amount was US$24.1M(Twenty Four million One Hundred Thousand united states dollars).  As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through a friends who works with the Ministry of Information here in Cotonou-Benin.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant,we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designated bank account.  May I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as I have made arrangements for a successful arrangement as an insider of the bank before contacting you. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone bills, while 60% will be for me and my partners.  Please, you have been adviced to keep this a top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.  I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in.  All other necessary information will be sent to you on your acceptance to champion this transaction with me.

In any case,I am left with no option but to contact you in this manner. my decision to write to you was informed by knowledge that being established personally that you could be disposed to understand my predicament in order to give me the assistance I require I am Frank Siaka the son of a late Sierra-Leonian businessman, late Dr.Coleman Siaka the owner of (RMS) Mining Company in Sierra-Leone, who died few years ago when the Revolutionary United Front Rebels (R.U.F) attacked our residence on the 11 of Feb. 2004 in Makeni Sierra-Leone. Following the cease fire agreement which was reached last year with the help of United Nation peace keeping troops, I used the opportunity to leave the country with a very important document of (US$ 7,650,000.00) Seven Million Six Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars, deposited by my late father in Security Company in South Africa, under my name. This money was realized from diamond export, now I and my mother are seeking asylum in South Africa under (UNHCR). I contacted you because of the need to deal with person whom my family and I have no previous personal relationships, and I confirmed your country as being economic conducive for investment and her people as transparent and trust-worthy to engage in business, hence my reason for writing you however, this money in question has been in the security company since his death. But my main problem now is that at my age of 28yrs, I am confused on how to handle this huge amount of money and also what to do with it as I don\'t have anyone to confide in South Africa here. May I use this medium to request from you if you will be disposed enough to help me keep this huge amount in your country or any other place of your choice that will have more security to the money and the life of me and my family? I have met the security company with the depositional documents that my father left behind, of which my name appears as the "Next Of Kin”, the company awaits my coming for the withdrawal, and I am even afraid of disclosing the content to them since my father in his letter had warned me against that. If it appeals to you to help me, I will suggest you take a trip to South Africa for us to meet face to face and finalize before moving the fund or if there is any other means you can suggest for the transferring of the fund to your very position pending my arrival to meet with you for investing of the money with any profitable business you introduce, as I have decided to do away with Africa entirely. I want immediate confirmation of your through our e-mail address. As soon as I get your response I shall give out more details on how we shall proceed. Kindly keep this proposal strictly confidential because of our present status here in South Africa. Thanks and remain blessed. I wait to receive a favorable response from you urgently.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to makethis  businness proposal to you and release the money to you via your foreign bank  account as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and   subsequent  disbursement since nobody is coming for it and this money Could go into the   Bank  treasury as unclaimed Bill.

N. P. C  ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO  Dear friend,  l am Dr Mallam Galadima., the contracts verification manager of  Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Because of my position  and that of other strategic officials who are heads in their  Departments, we have in our possession, since 2001 the sum of US$400M  Dolllars (Four hundred million United States Dollars) which we emassed  through over invoicing of foreign contracts fully executed and  commissioned with the different foreign contractors duely paid their  full contract amounts. We have made several fruitless moves to  transfer this fund abroad for our mutual benefits. One in 2002 when one  Mr. Lambert Brown of the United States of America, living at No 125 N.  Kinsley Ave. Ocean City, NJ 082216, ran away with our US$65M Dollars  after the fund has been transfered into his account. lt was  unbelievable, shocking and hypertensive that when we went there to  claim our share of the fund, we were told that nobody with that name  was living in that house and that the former occupant of the flat moved  away few weeks ago to an unkown house. This is how we lost US$65M  Dollars to the heartless Mr. Lambert Brown.  The second attempt was  when in 2003, we decided to carry US$50M dollars in cash through the  Lagos lnternational Airport but was stopped by the Nigerian Custom  Officers who seized the fund till date . This is how we lost another  US$50M Dollars to the Nigerian Custom.  Following the peaceful life  ushered in by the current democratic dispensation in Nigeria, l and my  colleages have decided to transfer the sum of US$22M (Twenty Two  Million dollars) into a foreign account operated by a foreigner for our  mutual benefits. By this letter, l request your assistance in  transferring and safeguarding the sum of US$22M Dollars for our mutual  benefits.  For assisting us in transferring and safeguarding this  fund, you will be entitled to 35% of the total sum 5% will be set aside  for charity and philantropic purposes 57% belongs to me and my  colleagues while 3% will go for reimbursement of all expenses made by  both parties. However, l want you to be human and humane so that you do  not become this second Mr. Lambert Brown of the United States. lt is  imperative to note that this transaction is risk free as all modalities  for the successful transfer of this fund have been perfected by my  colleagues in the relevant ministries.  However, we should see  absolute confidentiality as our watchword throughout the course of this  transaction for we are civil servants and will equally not like the  2002 event to redramatise itself.  l will not be ungrateful if you can  urgently furnish me with your private telephone, fax and mobile numbers  and name of beneficiary with the telex numbers of the receiving bank.  These will enable us speed up the claim of the fund and eventual  transfer into your nominated account.

Martin Goudale  martinxk1@hotmail.com ", 'PLEASE READ AND GET BACK TO ME Dear Friend  This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I   believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and   business partners.   I am Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN, currently Head of   Corporate affairs with a reputable bank here in Dubai -U. A. E. I write   you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with   the information I am about to reveal to you.  I have an urgent and very   confidential business proposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an   Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM   CORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) for 36   calendar months, valued at  US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five   hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his   account officer before I was moved to my present position recently.     Upon maturity in 2003, as his account officer and as well the bank   manger, it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a   routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was   returned undelivered.   After sometime, I tried sending back the   letter, but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his   contract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Khalil Al   Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein   (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his country Iraq,   as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. On further   investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nasser’s family wife and two   sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not   declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents,   including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any   WILL. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under   dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have   heard from the owner since 2003.   I wish to let you know that all the   investigation I have made so far, my bank management is not aware of   it, I am the only one that have the information.  With the recent change   of government in my country and with their efforts to support the   United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. By end of   this year, the government will pass a new financial control law which   will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of   above $5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it   is not for terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the   country immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely   confiscate the money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner   to explain the source of the money. I cannot directly transfer out this   money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting   you for an assistance.   As the Account Officer to late Al Nasser,   coupled with my present position and status in the bank as Head of   Retail Banking Group, I have the power to influence the release of the   funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account,   with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give   you. All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully   worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction   will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you   from any breach of law, beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes.  If   you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to   share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied.   If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message   so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God   bless you.   Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send   you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when the   deposit was made for your perusal.   I wait your urgent reply through my   private emailaddress:  Regards,   Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN. ', "Art: Sir/Madam Art: Sir/Madam My Dearest One My name is Nelson Koromba(22)my sister Sera(13)Koromba.

I am Mr Mcuty Udoa,19years old and the only Son of my late parents  MR.and MRS MUSTAPHA UDOA. My father was a highly reputable busnness  magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of LIBERIAN during  his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France  during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.Febuary 2004.Though  his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been  masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.  But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and  since then my father took me so special. Before his death on Febuary  12th 2004 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital  and told him that he has the sum of Ten Million United State  Dollars.(USD$10 000 000) left in a security company in a mettalic trunk  box, but the security company didn't know the content because it was  registered as family valuables personal for security reasons.  I am just 21 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't  know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a  result of incessant political crisis here in LIBERIAN . The death of my  father actually brought sorrow to my life. Sir,I am in a sincere desire  of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas  will be highly regarded. Now permit me to ask these few questions:-  1. Can I completely trust you?  2. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you?  Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.  Thank you so much.

I got your contact when i was making some searches in the internet.  My name is Mrs Atiya Mohameed, a Liberian. I was until recently the wife of Mr. Ibrahim Mohameed  who was the chief army officer to my country Libera. I am contacting you  to seek your co-operation in investing $USD10.M in your company or your country,s economy.  My  husband made this money when he was on sit as the commander and chief army officer while  Charles Taylor is the president  of Liberia.  Due to some religious and political problems , my husband was  hijacked and brutally assasainated by the rebel leathers in Liberia.  It is worthy to note that during my husband\'s life time he used his position as a former chief aid to must have made this money in question.  This money was realised from  the sales of gold and diamond ,which are the country\'s major resources and sources of income.And before his death ,my husband was able to send this money via a Ghanian diplomatic contact to the country ,where it is currently secured with a security company as a FAMILY  TREASURE   and  my name was used as the depositor in view of my husband,s position as an insider in the government.  And it was my husband,s refusal to realise the money to former President Charles Taylor that resulted in the killing in February 2003.  Now , that i have passed through the mourning ordeal for my husband  I am   thinking and planning the next step to take with respect to how  and where  to invest the money.  So my aim of sending this mail to you is to solicit your assistance in transfering this money to your country where it could be invested in a viable business for our mutual benefit. I am ready to enter into a joint venture with your company or we can open a new company with the money because i\'m sure the money inside the box can establish a company of any type.  I want to assure you that you will be highly rewarded for your assistance both in cash or in the joint venture.  Please reply to this mail, indicating your ability to handle this transaction so that i will give you details to enable us map out strategies for the implementation of this project.

Before his death on Febuary 12th 2004 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of Ten Million United State Dollars.(USD$12.200 000) left in a security company in a mettalic trunk box, but the security company didn't know the content because it was registered as family valuables personal for security reasons.  I am just 21 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. Dear,I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. Now permit me to ask these few questions:-  1. Can I completely trust you?  2. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you?  Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.  Thank you so much.

EXPECTING YOUR IMMEDIATE RESPONSE.THANKS FOR YOUR ADVANCE CO-OPERATION.PLEASE REPLY TO THIS EMAIL :krarosa031@yahoo.com  KIND REGARDS  MISS KRA ROSALINE ", 'Asking for your Urgent response Dear Friend, First, I must apologise to you for using this medium to  communicate about this transaction, though it is my great pleasure in  writing you this letter on behalf of my colleague and myself. I am Mr.  Idrissa Diop the Director of Bill and Exchange at the Foreign  Remittance Department in the bank where I work. I am writing to you  this urgent proposal following the impressive information about you  through one of my friends who runs a consultancy firm. Though, I did  not disclose to him the nature of my proposal to you to avoid any  leakage. My colleague and I have decided to contact you on a business  transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end. I  would be brief and direct to ensure you understand everything properly. In my department we discovered an abandoned Sum of $13.7M USD  (Thirteen Million, Seven Hundred Thousand US Dollars), in an account  that belongs to one of our foreign customers, an American by name: Mr.  John Schelpert who died along with his wife and other passengers in  EgyptAir Flight 990 - October 31, 1999. Since we got information about  his untimely death, the fund has been dormant in his account with my  Bank without any claim, we have been expecting his next of kin to come  over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody  applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased and the  person must be a foreigner as indicated in our banking guidelines.  Before our observation in this development, we discovered that the  owner of the account died without a Heir/WILL hence the money is  floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be  forfeited for nothing. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates  that if such money remained unclaimed after Six (6) years, the money  will be transfered into the Bank treasury account as unclaimed fund. It  is therefore upon this discovery that I and my junior colleague in the  bank now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the  money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety  and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we do not  want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. Meanwhile the whole arrangement to put claim over these fund as the  bonafide next of kin to the deceased and transfer this money to a  foreign account has been put in place. Directives and needed  information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your  interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit from this great  business opportunity. We could have done this deal on our own, but  because of our position in this country operating a local account would  eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer  because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will  require foreigner as second party that will forward claims as the next  of kin to the Bank and also present a designated safe foreign account  where he will need the money to be transferred into after due  verification and clearification by the bank. May I at this point  emphasize that this transaction is a successful arrangement, and as an  insider of the bank I have the capacity to monitor that everything is  smoothly perfected. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will  be entitled to your own share of the total sum as gratification We have  agreed that 20 % of this money will be for you as our foreign partner,  in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 5% will be set aside  for expenses incured during the business and 75% would be for me and my  colleague. There after I and my colleague will visit your country for  disbursement according to the percentages indicated. This share of  yours is negotiable as long as it is reasonable. Please, you have been  adviced to keep this information a topsecret as we are still in service  and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.  I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you  confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your  country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages we  shall agree upon. All other necessary information will be sent to you  on your acceptance to champion this transaction with us. I suggest you  get back to me as soon as possible, stating your wish in this deal.  Please do call me on my direct line for more clearifications: 00221 688  8466 Thanks and best regards.

The money was packed in a sealed trunk box and was depositd Security/Finance Company in Spain.Right now, the present government has intensified their probe on my family's financial resources; frozen all our known foreign & local accounts, revoked Diamond licenses, and even detained my son (Charles) on alleged flimsy charges just because my husband before his death was the head of UNITA.Bearing in mind thatyour assistance is needed to transfer this money, I propose a commission of 10% (Ten Percent) of the total sum to you or your company for the expected services and assistance.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for our bank to release the money to you. You have to follow the instruction which I will send to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill.     The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after 6 years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than 5 years and I am preparing documentaion to prove that this money has been transfered to our bank treasury. It will be between me and you only that will know that the money is not transfered into our treasure. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Senegalese cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.     In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering you 30% of the total sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other charges) likely to be incurred during the course of transaction, while the remaining 65% is for me.  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application which you will complete and forward to our bank asking for this money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thomson. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

Attn:The President Dear Sir, I write to solicite your assistance and support to enable me execute a  very  lucrative and high profiting business transaction.I am very  sure that with  trust and understanding,we will be able to execute this busines to our  mutual benefit and believe that you will not let down the  trust I am  willing to repose in you. I work for an Ivorien based import and export firm ("a-MIC"), I work product  sourcing manager. Between the 17th -19th of may, 2002 a  business seminar  was held in BOUAKE Cote Divoire  of which I attended.While in the Seminar, I  was opportuned to meet ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD ,the President of  ALI-MAHMOUD DAIRY & CATTLE FARMS ETS. ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD isan  accomplished and widely known and recognised millionaire farmer in this part  of the region. He has cattle farms in different  countries. Above all, he is  one of the greatest supplier  of cattle,beef and other diary products in  this part of the coast.On getting to know my proffesion, ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI  MAHMOUD took me into confidence by informing me about the purchase of a  particular but very  important medicine for his cattle. He informed me that  he buys this  product at $5,000.00 USD per carton, and that he mostly buys  to the excess  of 450 cartons. He informed me that he would like me to find  out if my organisation could source for him a cheaper supplier considering  the  recent trend of falls in the general price of beef in the world market   which is affecting his business. Back in my office, I discussed this proposal with my boss and he  decided to  handle the  supply by himself.We carried out a market research and   discovered that we could purchase this medicine somewhere cheaper in EUROPE  for $2,000.00 USD per carton . We moved a proposal to ALI-MAHMOUD DAIRY &  CATTLE FARMS ETS. to make the supply to them at $4,800.00 USD per carton of  which  he accepted. Owing to my role in the transaction, I had an agreement  with my  director to be receiving 15% of whatever gain is made on each  supply of which he agreed. But on the completion of the suply and the  receipt of the payment, my boss renegated on our agreement and refused to  give me my  share of the profit. Since then our relationship has been at its  lowest  ebb. I have since accepted it as one of life experiences. However, as God would have it, recently, I ran into ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI  MAHMOUD and he informed me that he would want us to urgently supply him   with 1250 cartons of the same product before the end of Dec 2006.I  used the  oppurtunity to inform Alhaji that I can  introduce him to the main producer  of this vaccine who can supply him  the product at $4,400.00 USD if he will  pay in advance as he usually  does. He was very pleased and has assured me  that he is not going to contact my boss again for this vaccine. He is  now  waiting for me to link him to the producer of the vaccine. We will buy the medicine at $2,000.00 USD from EUROPE and sell  at  $4,400.00 USD TO ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD,with him making a down  payment of  50% of our quoted price first. If you are interested and capable of handling this supplies on my  behalf,kindly get back to me urgently through my e-mail,so that we can agree  on the terms and profit sharing,after which I can then furnish you with the  contacts of both our source in EUROPE and that of ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI  MAHMOUD . Kindly be notified that at no point in time should you let  ALHAJI  NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD know that you are not the producer of the medicine and  we  should never allow him to know the contact of our real source in EUROPE  so that he would\'nt bypass us to deal  directly with them.

My  husband made this money when he was on sit as the commander and chief army officer while  Charles Taylor is the president  of Liberia.  Due to some religious and political problems , my husband was  hijacked and brutally assasainated by the rebel leathers in Liberia.  It is worthy to note that during my husband\'s life time he used his position as a former chief aid to must have made this money in question.  This money was realised from  the sales of gold and diamond ,which are the country\'s major resources and sources of income.And before his death ,my husband was able to send this money via a Ghanian diplomatic contact to the country ,where it is currently secured with a security company as a FAMILY  TREASURE   and  my name was used as the depositor in view of my husband,s position as an insider in the government.  And it was my husband,s refusal to realise the money to former President Charles Taylor that resulted in the killing in February 2003.  Now , that i have passed through the mourning ordeal for my husband  I am   thinking and planning the next step to take with respect to how  and where  to invest the money.  So my aim of sending this mail to you is to solicit your assistance in transfering this money to your country where it could be invested in a viable business for our mutual benefit. I am ready to enter into a joint venture with your company or we can open a new company with the money because i\'m sure the money inside the box can establish a company of any type.  I want to assure you that you will be highly rewarded for your assistance both in cash or in the joint venture.

I have a proposal for you-this however is not mandatory nor will I in any  manner compel you to honour against your will. I am in a state of delinma and made up my mind to send you this mail , I am  ROSLINE MATHEW ,21 years old and the only daughter of my late parents Mr.  and Mrs. MATHEW NZOBEl. My father was a highly reputable business magnet (a cocoa merchant) who  operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of  his bus iness trips abroad on 12th.Febuary 2004. Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been  masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time. But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and  since then my father took me so special. Before his death on February 12 2004 he called the secretary who accompanied  him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of eight million, seven  hundred thousand United State Dollars.(USD$8.700,000) left in one of the  leading security company. He further told him that he depaosited the money in my name, and finally  issued a written instruction to his lawyer whom he said is in possession of  all the necessary legal documents to this fund and the security company . I am just 21 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know  what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result o  f incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father  actually brought sorrow to my life. I am in a sincere desire of your humble  assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly  regarded. Now permit me to ask these few questions:- 1. Can you honestly help me as your daughter? 2. Can I completely trust you? 3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you  after the money is in your account? Please, Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible. Thank you so much.Mey God bless you and your family.

Greetings to you and your family in the name of God. In my search for a reliable and God fearing person and having gotten your contact through prayers and painstaking efforts I have decided to seek your help in carrying out my last wishes. My name is Mrs.Marvis Smith. I'm a 65 years old woman and from Congo. I was a merchant and owned two businesses in Dubai. I was also married with two children. My husband and two children died in a car accident six years ago. Before this happened, my business and concern for making money was all I live for. I never really cared about other values in life. But since the loss of my family, I have found a new desire to assist helpless families. I have been helping orphans in orphanage/motherless homes. I have also donated some money for humanitarian needs in Sudan, South Africa, Cameroon, Brazil, Spain, Austria, Germany and some Asian countries. Only recently I saw on television the colossal loss of properties and livelihood people in Canberra, Australia through fire. I was moving with great pity and compassion that I decided to make this contribution on assisting people over there, I kept $US25,000,000.00 Million in a long-term deposit account in a Finance company. Presently, I'm in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for oesophagi cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only few months to live. It is my last wish to see this money distributed to victims of the fire outbreak in Australia and other charity organization. Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them. Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me collect the deposit and  distributes it accordingly. Use your judgment to distribute the money and keep 20% of it to yourself. Feel free to reimburse yourself when you have the money for any cost you incur during the process of collecting and distributing the money.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because it cannot be released unless somebody  applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately , all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind  for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you via your foreign bank account as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and  subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and this money Could go into the  Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money Remained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transferred into the  Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request for your assistance and maximum co-operation as a foreign citizen to stand as the next of kin in this  business is occasioned by the fact that the deceased customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. 40 % of this money will be for you as my foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account. 10 %will be set aside for expenses in cured  during the business and 50 % would be for me. There after I will come over to your  country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as the relation or next of kin to  the deceased, indicating your claims and wherein the money will be remitted .

This money was realised from  the sales of gold and diamond ,which are the country\'s major resources and sources of income.And before his death ,my husband was able to send this money via a Ghanian diplomatic contact to the country ,where it is currently secured with a security company as a FAMILY  TREASURE   and  my name was used as the depositor in view of my husband,s position as an insider in the government.  And it was my husband,s refusal to realise the money to former President Charles Taylor that resulted in the killing in February 2003.  Now , that i have passed through the mourning ordeal for my husband  I am   thinking and planning the next step to take with respect to how  and where  to invest the money.

Dear Friend In Christ, I believe you will treat this mail with the fear of God. It is with tears that I am writing you this mail; I don`t need your pity, but love to my son. My mail may seem very painful and sorrowful, but there is more you can do in my request than to pity me, which is to show LOVE to my son. I was an orphan and do not wish my son to experience what i have been through on Earth after an automobile crash that nearly claimed my life. My name is Edward Brown, married to the late Juan J.Brown, who died with our two daughters in Indonesia on 26th of December 2004 during the Tsunami Disaster, after this Painful and sorrowful incident, my condition worsened and I was diagnosed of cancer, which got worst and I have been suffering from heart failure and hepatitis since. My friends ignored me due to my relationship with God on sickbed. My wife, our children and I have been in United Kingdom for a long time. We all were suppose to travel to Indonesia in December 2004, but my bad health, did not permit me to travel with them, which made me and my son stay behind while my wife and our two daughters traveled. If not, all of us would have perished in the disaster. My reason of writing you this mail is due to the sad news that came to me recently from the doctors. After my last diagnosed result, it was proved by the doctors that i may not leave for more than one month ahead, due to the damage the cancer have caused in my system unless I undergo an urgent surgical operation which my chance of survival is less than 10% according to the medical experts. As it stands, I have given to fate and have found God on sick bed. But i have a more concern problem, which is why I have contacted you. Please, this is about my son. Since it is now obvious that i will die, my son's future has been the greatest problem i have. I want you to take care of my son please. He is only 13years and we have no person here to take care of him if I die today. My friends for knowing God deserted me. I left some money in a deposit house at United Kingdom, which i intended to use for investment in Indonesia. I want you to take this money and my son. Use the money into a big investment, that you will manage until my son grows up to take over the investment. I will like you to take my son as your own son, give him the love we the parents would have given him. Do not let him feel the pains of being an orphan, give him good education, bring him up into a responsible man. Make him have the fear of God. Please do not refuse this task. I have no one else to help me out on this issue, I am an orphan who grew up without knowing God rather focused on wealth and otherwise, living a life of fantasy and doesn't care or know who God is. Do not pity me, rather take good care of and bring him up to be God fearing. As soon as I receive your reply including your personal details, all i will do is to authorize my bank to transfer the money to your account directly and i will also draw up my will in your favor. I will give the bank all the documents that is covering the deposit with the bank, i will transfer every power and right of ownership to you stating at my Will to enable you claim the deposit from the bank. It will be also included in the Will that you are the only person my son should be released to, if i die. All i need is your acceptance and assurance that you will not treat my son badly. I am writing you this mail with great tears and i pray you will be kind & honest with fear of God concerning this mail to you today.

Since then I have made several enquiries to your Embassy to locate any of my client’s extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet, to locate any member of his family but of no avail, hence I contacted you. I have contacted you to assist me in repatriating the money left behind by my client before they got confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Finance House where these huge deposits were lodged. Particularly, the Finance House where the deceased had an account valued at about US$20.7M has issued me a notice to provide the next-of-kin or have the account confiscated within the next Forteen official working days. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over nine (9) months now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$20.7M can be paid to you and then you and I can share the money 60% to me and 35% to you, while 5% should be for expenses or tax as your government may required. I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make, all I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this transaction through.

ALI , WAITING TO READ FROM YOU SOONEST FROM THE DESK OF:MR . RAHA. ALI dIRECTOR AUDIT AND ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT, BANK OF AFRICA, OUAGA-BURKINA-FASO. ATTN: Please. Greetings to you, I am Mr.Raha.Ali. the Account Manager of Late Mr.Morris  Thompson in Bank of Africa, here in Burkina Faso.However I got your contact  through the International web directory.I decided to contact you by email  because I feel that it is more secured and private. Recently i discovered a Dormant Account with a huge amount of Money Valued  USD14,000,000.00 (Fourteen Million Dollars only)that belongs to one of our  late Customer who died in a plane crash. During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came  across a very huge sum of money belonging to Late Mr. Morris Thompson an  American great industrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately  lost his life in the plane  crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000,including his wife and only daughter. You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got during my  investigation;http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/ andttp://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html The fund has been dormant in his account With this Bank without any claim of  the funds in our custody either from his family or relation before our  discovery of this development. The Banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for Six  years, it will be forfeited to the Bank treasury as an unclaimed bill.It is  only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and It is upon this  discovery that I decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out this dormant fund. In order to avert this negative development, I on behalf of my trusted  colleagues now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to  Our late Customer so that the fund will be released and paid into your  account as the beneficiary´s next of kin now that the bank is still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased ,Late Mr. Morris  Thompson. In fact we could have done this deal alone but because of our position in  this country as civil servants, we are not allowed to operate a foreign  account and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the  time of transfer since I still work in this bank, this is the actual reason why I required a second party or fellow who will assist me forward  claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account  or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this fund, even an empty  a/c can also serve for this purpose. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% as  gratification for your assisting me, and the remaining 60% will be for me. What I want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin. I have  in my possession, all the necessary informations to successfully accomplish  this operation. Bear in mind that this proposal is 100% risk free. Further Information will be given to you as soon as I receive your positive  response. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your interest to enable us proceed. I await your Urgent Response Regrads, MR .RAHA.

We want to transfer to an oversea account ($16,700.000.00 USD) Sixteen Million Seven Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) from one of the banks located in Dakar Senegal. I want to ask you, If you are not capable to quietly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business ,I am trusting in you and believing in God that you will never let me down either now or in future.  I am Mr Philip Tarila. a personal assiatant to late Andreas Schranner. During the course of his bank's last week auditing,it was discovered that since his death no one has come forward to lay claim to this funds.So  the bank issued me a memo to provide his next of kin or forfeith the funds. This account was opened with the bank in 1999 and since 2000 nobody has operated on this account again, after going through some old files in my records,I discovered that my late client  died without a [Heir/WILL] hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.

Brian in the US Marine Corps on Monitoring and Peace a  keeping mission in Baghdad-Iraq. The reason why I am explaining  my finding  to you is to seek for your assistance to enable you contributes  immensely to the actualization of my dreams.  On the 18th day of March 2007, we were alerted on the presence of some  terrorists hideouts in Haifa Street, a long thoroughfare of high-rise  buildings built by Saddam Hussein here in Baghdad.  After Immediate intervention by the Iraqi forces and ours, we were able  to  capture many foreign Arab fighters linked to al Qaeda in that operation and  over 100 militants were killed on the process. Among the  Arab fighters  linked to al Qaeda two were interrogated by two of our  intelligent  investigators and I. They confessed that some of them are  fighters for al  Qaeda and some are for Ayman al-Zawahiri and they took us to  some of their  hideout which runs along the west bank of the Tigris River  that cuts through  the capital.  When we invaded into the hideout, we recovered several guns, amour including  some boxes among which two contains bullets, one filled with  hard  drugs  (heroine) and the other two to my amazement contain some US Dollars  which we assumed amounted to $23.2M after I and two of the  intelligent  investigators counted them and it took us over 4 hours to get  it counted.  I however instructed them to keep this in high secrecy so that we can have  the money to our selves, they all agreed to the plan and they  replied to me  on how I can get this huge sum out of this country and I  told them that  ital&#8482;s no problem.  This motivated me to connive with my best friend in our force who went with  me and the two other officers to keep the boxes in a safer place.  I am now in keen need of a "Reliable and Trustworthy" person like you who  would receive, secure and protect these boxes containing the US Dollars for  me  untill my assignment elapses here.  I assure and promise to give you 20% of this fund, however feel free to  negotiate what you wish to have as your percentage in this deal.

I am about to tell you something that I have not discuss with anyone excluding my lawyer. My father was a big time farmer in south Africa, he uses most of South Africa land for farming. The Government in South Africa gave him those lands for farming and he will pay back when he have the money, it was like a loan they gave him the lands as loan My father was very successful In the farming business and he paid all the Government back. Some top officials In the Government were Jealous because of his wealth. They wanted him to Join them carry out a dubious deal against the Government but he refuse ,so they plan to kill him and claim all his wealth he has suffered for, in South Africa. On his way home one day he was coming from the office and he was assassinated and he was rushed to the hospital by a good Samaritan. But he did not survive It .But before they killed him he saw It coming and transfer most of his fund to a Security company In Holland. He died In the hospital ,But before he died he gave me the contact Information to the Security company which the fund was located. Those people were looking for me and my family and we ran to Nigeria for safety because they know we know were my father funds were hidden. I contacted the Security company yesterday on how I could collect the funds with my lawyer assistance and they told me that I need a foreign beneficiary outside Africa because of Security reasons. And I don�t have anyone outside Africa that will stand for me as a beneficiary.  They said the money was too big (TWENTY MILLION USDOLLARS)My father never  told me the amount of the money I was so shock.

Dear Friend, I am the manager of auditing and accounting at the foreign remittance  department of BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) here in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. In  my department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$15m dollars (Fifteen   Million US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign  customer (MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany) who died along with  his entire family in Jully 2000 in a plane crash.For more informations about  the crash you can visit this site:  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that  all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the  plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is  coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as  unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed after seven  years, the money will be transfered into the bank  treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this  business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a  Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision  of a foriegn account ,10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the  business and 60% would be for me Thereafter, I will visit your country for  disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to enable the  immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply first to the  bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of application  that i will send to you,so i will like you to send to me your private  telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location  where in the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of  the application .

Toda la Copa América, en Starmedia http://pan.segundosfuera.com/copaamerica/', 'please read and get back to me Beloved,  I am sorry for my unannounced communication with you especially through this common method but I promise to give you more reasons for this in due course.  I am Nopparat Sujaritpinij from Thailand (nopparat.sujaritpinij@worker.com). I worked with Terry Ford 51, a white farmer in Zimbabwe till his sudden death in March, 2002. My boss, Terry Ford was a rich commercial and successful farmer in Zimbabwe till the land reforms of Mugabe led government which exposed many white farmers to the brutality of the black "war veterans" who in one of their attacks shot and killed him.  In case you are not familiar with this incident, you can look it up in any international news media like; http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1878846.stm , http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2002/03/18/zimbabwe020318.html.  Well, I am contacting you in respect of a deposited fund which is to the tone of us$16 million which was meant for the purchase of farm tools and accessories. Since his death, I have thought of a way forward but with the continuous stay of the funds with bank, the government may trace it which means a total lost hence I arranged for the withdrawal.  I successfully withdrew the funds and re-deposited it with a private security company as a family treasure. As it is, I am well informed about farming and could do any other business as well but all I need now is a partner to help me in settling down this funds in any account(s) be it personal or company\'s account.  Please, is rest assured that it is between me and you and so shall I like it to remain. Again, the funds in question as it is has nothing whatsoever to do with Zimbabwe any longer as I urge you to feel free in dealing with me as no risk is involved.  In dealing with you, I am ready to compensate your efforts with 17% of the total funds while 3% will be to reimburse any form of expenses from your side otherwise, we can work on partnership in all investments.  I will wait to hear from you as I will be ever ready to supply you with every details of myself as well as that of the transaction.

This is by virtue of its nature CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET.

I was a member of the Abuja National stadium building and organizing Committee of the just concluded "ALL AFRICAN GAMES" which was organized and hosted by Nigeria but before now I have been a director of sports in the Federal Ministry of Sports and Youth Development. We were appointed over 3 years ago to supervise the building of the ultra modern Abuja National Stadium, putting in place all equipments needed for the completion of the stadium which is acclaimed to be one of the best in the world today and also involved in the planning and hosting of the games. This project cost the government of Nigeria Millions of dollars. The stadium project has been completed; all equipments put in place and Commissioned and used for the All African Games tagged "ABUJA 2003". The accounts have been rendered to the government satisfactorily and we have received commendations for a job well done. During the construction, planning and execution of this project, as the Chairman of contract award committee I was able to make some money for myself through contract that was awarded to Dewolfgang Gmbh, which I over-invoiced to the tune of USD18.5M with the help of Dewolfgang Gmbh the original contractor. All I want you to do is to assist me in clearing this amount while standing in as the owner and director of Vacknol Nigeria International Limited in whose name I made as the beneficiary of the funds. Vacknol Nigeria International Limited is an international company and could have a company anywhere in the world the most important thing been that it is registered here in Nigeria as a limited liability company in line with the company and allied matters decree of Nigeria which I have since done, I have also in my possession some contract document which will act as proof that Vacknol Nigeria International Limited executed the contract as a sub contractor under the Dewolfgang Gmbh who is the major contractor that executed the contract that was over -invoiced. On the payment of this money to you as the supplier in the name of Vacknol Nigeria International limited because I will apply for the transfer in this name, and you as the director of the company. I will come to meet with you so that we can both sit down and discuss further, what kind of business we will enter into or if need be expand your already existing business, but actually I hope to establish a five star hotel and go into real estate development as these are life time businesses that I know are of high yields interest any where in the world. I know you will be entitled to some percentage of this money as Compensation for your efforts, please feel free to indicate what you will take from this amount, as this is very important to me before we commence proceedings. I will tell you more about this when I hear from you. I will give you every detail of what we are to do. I want to assure you my dear friend that with your cooperation and understanding the sky will be our limit.  Please do contact me immediately.

Direct Telephone; +44-703-189-3319 Direct Fax; +44-700-594-2286  Good Day Dear, My name is JONATHAN WRIGHT, Principal Partner in CASTLE Law Chambers,  London,UK. I was formally a personal attorney to Mr. Mohammed Saibi who  was the chairman of Algosaibi Diving and marine Services in Dhahran,  Saudi Arabia. Mr. Saibi died late last year of heart attack at the ripe  age of 79 years. Mr. Mohammed Saibi a Saudi Arabia Philanthropist, before he died, made  a Will in my law firm stating that $3.2M (Three million, Two Hundred  Thousand U.S. dollars only) should be donated to any charity home of our  choice overseas as his last contribution to humanity when it became  obvious that he will not stay alive for too long. His only son, Rasheed  Saibi and his entire family has no knowledge of this. However, I am very much aware that he has left enough wealth that will  last his generation a lifetime. The true situation at the moment is  that the said amount of money was deposited with the BANK here in UK only  to be paid out to a charity home.The charity home/organization would  have to be picked by my law office. This implies that you will stand as  the beneficiary to this Will so that the funds could be processed and  transferred to your account if you are ready and in a position to assist  me. You do not need to have a charity organization, all you need do is  to declare your interest and show seriousness. As a professional lawyer, I have mapped out strategies which I will use  to obtain all the proper/legal documentations and last approval from  Ministry of Finance concerning the funds which I will send the copies  across to you for your perusal and record puppose before the bank will  contact you. I am particularly interested in securing this money from the Bank  because they have issued a notice instructing us to produce the beneficiary  of this Will as soon as possible, else the account would be made  dormant since Mr. Saibi was ill for a long period of time before his  demise.If you are interested in assisting me, I will give you 30% of the entire  funds after paying taxes due to your government and expenses incurred  during the course of this transaction. The balance will be mine  although I intend to send some of it to a charity organization. I urge you to contact me immediately for further details if you are  satisfied with my proposition and feel you are in a position to assist me.  Bearing in mind the confidential nature of this transaction. For the trust I have on you, I believe that you have the ability to  handle this transaction, I will Prefer you respond through this particular  mail or call me on my direct phone indicated above.

FROM DR USMAN IBRAHIM DANKO. AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT. FOREIGN OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT. BANQUE TOGOLAISE POUR LE COMMERCE ET L'INDUSTRIE, LOME- TOGO.  Dear Friend,             I do not intend to cause any grief to you. The reason for sending this mail is very fundamental to the doctrine of human privileges and right. My name is Dr Usman Ibrahim Danko  I am quite convicned of the fact that this will come to you as a surprise.however I am writing based on the privlage information I garthered about you in internet during my extensive search for a repose foreign partner who is compitent of assisting me in below business proposal. I am the principal manager controlling the auditing and accounting section of Banque Togolaise Pour Le Commerce Et L'Inustrie Lome Togo. in West Africa with due respect and regard.  I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person Mr Wahid Yoffe who died in the horrific Asian tsunamis of Dec. 26, 2004, that has killed more than all 20th- century tsunamis combined that happened in Sumatra island, Indonesia.  From the information that our bank have gotten so far, the Tsunami killed him with his entire family and no none relation have been identified. The person that he used as his next of kin was his first son of 25 years old who died along side with the entire family. Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself and partner to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amount was (US$11.4M).  Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity that comes once in life. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant, we are not allowed to perate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank.  This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also resent a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred in to on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.  May I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as I have made arrangements for a successful deal before contacting you. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer processing and also telephone bills, while 65% will be for me and my partner.  Please, you have been adviced to keep top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in.  All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this deal. Yours Sincerely,  Dr Usman Ibrahim Danko.
