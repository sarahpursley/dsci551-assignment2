One thing that has always been a bit of a problem is the fact that the utilities have to buy power from the generators at a high price, which means that if the prices are too high, then there is a market failure and the price goes back down.  So if the price goes back down, then there is a loss of revenue - and that is what happened when we cut rates.  So if the price goes back down, then there is a need for the utilities to buy power again.  That is one of the reasons why we have the PUC rating.  Because it is based on real-time costs rather than just throwing billions of dollars at a problem, it is less likely to get us in court.

The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) has been forced to defend itself against claims by the California Power Exchange (CPUE) that it is being shorted money by the state. CAISO data shows that the CPUE shorted more money than it paid in electricity in August - a charge that has been widely attributed to market forces.  The CPUE responded by filing an emergency lawsuit seeking refunds to customers.  The CPUE has argued that the lawsuit is unfair and unfair on it and other utilities because it seeks to recover money shorted by the state.  The CPUE has argued that the lawsuit is an unreasonable burden on the agency because it seeks to recover money shorted by the state.\nThe CPUE has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit because the lawsuit is "unconscionable and procedurally excessive."  The motion states that the CPUE "has been shorted billions of dollars by the State of California and its Defendants."  The CPUE has also

H.R. 2646 (110th) was introduced in the 114th Congress by Congressman Barney Frank (R-Mass.) and Senator Frank (R-MO).  It is intended to restore direct access to the electricity markets and revitalize the power industry.  It is designed to restore direct access to the investor-owned, publicly-traded Edison Company, and would make it easier for small and medium-scale producers to access wholesale electricity markets.  It would also restore direct access to the investor-owned Public Utilities, which were forced to exit the market due to deregulation following the passage of the 1996 Energy Reform and Control Act.  Because of its small size (just under 1/2 million square feet), Direct Access to retail electricity is relatively new and difficult to maintain.  Therefore, Congress enacted the Direct Access to Retail Electricity Act of 1996, which provides direct access to approximately 3.3 million customers annually.  The Act requires the Secretary of Energy to construct and maintain a national

A Florida man is facing charges after police say he set off a "potential egg" on the holiday market by buying up "any and all" cell phones at gunpoint.
 \nInvestigators with the Palm Beach County Sheriff\'s Office said they recovered a "potential egg" last week at the hands of the group\'s customers, who are now demanding that the county release details of its phone-hogging.
  The egg, they said, was intended to scare away cell phones that are carrying the virus.  The county, however, says that it has not received any requests to turn off the virus.  \nInvestigators said the man, identified only by his last name, Edward, bought up phones at gunpoint that were then turned off by his customers.  He then sold the phones to another individual, who turned them back on.  \nInvestigators said the man, now in his 20s, then turned the phones back on and started taking pictures.

"We will not let these companies continue to be a place for criminals," said SEC Commissioner Rogers. "This is the beginning of a national effort to stop this activity." The companies will be required to hand over all data associated with their operations for the federal government, and will also be required to hand over customer data for up to 24 months.

The California Attorney General says it will file suit against the California Power Exchange over a "systematic misuse of confidential information."  Attorney General Kaminski says the suit will "raise fundamental issues of due process."  The AG says the suit is the result of an "unconscionable amount of misconduct by the AG."  The AG says the suit "will likely amount to a Ponzi scheme by the AG to artificially inflate market prices."  The AG says the AG's actions violate the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, which prohibits "unconscionable and unfair competition."  The AG says the AG will file a class action.

The California Public Utilities Commission is considering whether it should bar wholesale energy trading on the basis of a market-based approach that accounts for price changes in the absence of market forces.  The commission\'s decision on whether to consider such a framework is expected to be announced today.  The commission\'s decision is expected to be based on a "market-based" approach, which would avoid the need for market participants to construct and maintain monopolies.  The commission\'s decision is expected to be based on an "inelastic supply of available electricity."  The "inelastic demand" standard, adopted in 1996, was intended to provide a basis for establishing net metering in the absence of market forces.  The commission\'s decision to consider the "inelastic supply of available electricity" language in the definition of "inelastic" in electricity supply  is intended to reflect the fact that the electricity market in California is dynamic and subject to change.

Generators and traders purchase electricity and generate it in various forms including retail and wholesale rates. Rates are determined by net metering and the use of wholesale electricity. Retail rates are fixed at 3 cents/ kilowatt hour (kWh) for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and are affected by seasonal and other market factors. The Real Time Market was established in 1996 and is managed by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR). Data are posted daily on the DWR web site.

The CPUC has decided to proceed with the DWR power purchase restriction, with the intent of\nestablishing a DWR-controlled wholesale power market.  The CPUC\'s decision to\nproceed with this restriction is consistent with the decision issued in April\nregarding the DWR power purchase restriction.  The CPUC\'s decision to\nrecognize the DWR power purchase restriction as part of the California wholesale\npower market was based on the need to ensure that the DWR power purchase\nrestrictive was applied in the context of the Direct Access to Power scheme contemplated by\nSection 2.1.2 of the California Electricity Code.  In light of the\nCPUC\'s decision, the CPUC\'s policy of not issuing directions to the DWR\nregulatory agency DWR-ISO for the DWR power purchase restriction is likely to be\nremoved.

The European Commission has taken the lead in suggesting that it may consider imposing a tariff on wholesale electricity imports from non-ECURAL suppliers in order to stimulate demand in the energy markets.  The Commission has stated that it would consider a tariff if there is a demand for energy that is beyond the reach of the Commission.  The Commission is concerned that the price charged by the energy suppliers may be excessive and that they have in fact been able to recover their costs from the market price charged by the energy suppliers.  The Commission has also stated that it would consider a tariff if there is a demand for energy that is beyond the reach of the Commission.  The Commission has therefore stated that it would consider a tariff if there is a demand for energy that is beyond the reach of the Commission.

The price tag for the power plant is pegged at $4.4 billion, and it is expected to generate more than 60 percent of the megawatt hours that California delivers to the market during peak periods.  The price reflects the wholesale price, which is generally frozen at the state level.  The price reflects the energy component of the price component, which is either paid by the utility or retained by the user.  The price component of wholesale electricity is determined by the price paid for wholesale electricity in August, which is used to compute the monthly wholesale energy price.  When prices for energy in August are different from the prices charged in July, the utilities calculate the difference between the August and July prices. The difference is the difference between the amount of energy that was sold in August and the amount of energy that was sold in July, which is determined by dividing (1) the amount of energy sold in August by the total amount of energy sold in August, and (2) the total amount

The South Florida Sun Sentinel reports that the state Department of Water Resources (DWR) is considering replacing the generators with "independent" owners. The DWR has said it will have enough electricity to meet demand through mid-August, even if it is short of the 2.3 million megawatt hours required to meet that demand. The utility said it is considering this option only if it is "fully owned." The DWR is expected to announce its decision next week. The newspaper says that the state is considering replacing the generators with "independent" owners, but that it will need the money to pay for the replacement. The newspaper says that the state is also considering buying power from "independent" sources, but that it is still "looking at" whether it is time to "share" the cost with "independent" sources.

When the price of wholesale electricity spiked in August, the wholesale price in California spiked sharply. The price in August spiked sharply to record levels, while the August peak price in August spiked sharply to record levels. Both cycles have been strongly influenced by factors such as high demand and high prices in August.  The August surge in prices reflects both a high demand for wholesale electricity and a marked increase in the wholesale price during the California summer months of May and June.  During the August surge, prices in August spiked sharply to record levels, while the August peak price in August spiked sharply to record levels.  Both cycles have been strongly influenced by factors such as high demand and high prices in August.\x01; Technically, the peak prices in August were driven largely by demand for electricity during the summer months of May and June.

A new report indicates that California's electricity marketplaces have been deregulated and out-regulated for the past several years. The report, "The State of Electricity Markets in California," by the California Public Utilities Commission and the Los Angeles Times revealed extensive evidence that market participants in California's megawatt-hour market, known as the California wholesale market, have been out-regulated and out-regulated for the past several years. In addition, the report revealed that state and local market participants in California's wholesale electricity market, known as the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), were out-regulated and out-regulated for the past several years. "This is the worst possible state of affairs for California," said Alan Comnes, director of the Edison Project's Market Surveillance Unit.

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has approved a $7.1 billion contract to purchase power from Cargill (the "Company").  The deal is subject to a US court order, but the deal is continuing, so it's not clear when the order will be lifted.  The deal is expected to be in the final form for a total of $15.9 billion.  The USDA says that Cargill will pay an "estimate" of $7.2 billion, which is a figure that will likely increase if the deal is not continued.  Cargill says that it will pay an "estimate" of $7.3 billion, which is a figure that is significantly higher than the $7.1 billion that the USDA approved.

The state of California is in dire need of a major overhaul.  The legislature passed a law last month that basically deregulates the industry, ending the state's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E).  PG&E is one of the state\'s largest retail customers, and has been scrambling to recover from the state\'s worst power market crisis in decades.  PG&E, which is one of California\'s largest electricity producers, has been hit by a $4 billion in state power surcharges, and desperately needs federal help to recover.  PG&E is one of the state\'s few remaining reliability threats, and is scrambling to recover from a $2 billion price-fixing scandal that has cost it dearly in the past.  PG&E\'s precarious financial state is prompting the state\'s Attorney General to call for an investigation of the utility\'s actions.  Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said last week that the state is in dire

The preliminary sampling of the California electricity market has revealed disappointing results for the state.  In addition, the market for wholesale electricity, which accounts for more than 80% of California\'s energy consumption, has been depleting markets nationwide.  California\'s utilities, Edison and PG&E, have been forced to slash their wholesale rates, cutting their retail rates, and imposing costly out-of-state rates on their customers.  The result has been a dramatic depletion of market share and a dearth of investment in new investment opportunities.  California\'s electric generating industry, which accounts for more than 75% of its electricity generation, has been in financial straits and in deep financial straits for years.  The crisis has damaged the state\'s economy and threatened to drive California\'s power industry into default on its loans.  Governor Gray Davis has ordered a major restructuring of the state\'s electrical industry to address the crisis.  Governor Davis\' order will direct the state\'s

A Look Back At The\nEmerging Power Markets," was released today by the Public Interest Research Group.\nThe report, which looks at market data from 2000-03, says that the\nregulatory commission did not "review" its power market structure during the summer of\n2000. The report also says that the market for wholesale electricity in California\nhas grown by more than 70% between 2000 and 2003, despite the fact that the\nindustry's previous leader, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO),\ncontinues to enjoy robust market access.\n"The commission continued its work in February to collect market data on the wholesale market\nfor electricity between 2000 and 2003 and use that data to calibrate its power\n

The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) has received a $2.7 million bribe from a senior executive at Reliant Energy Services Inc. (RLS) to install a system in their system.     The bribe was to persuade RLS to purchase electricity from the utility.                                                                                                                                             
====================
The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) has been ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to disclose certain information relating to the\nmarketing, solicitation, and sharing of wholesale electricity.  CAISO documents filed\nwith the FERC indicate that the ISO engaged in at least two acts of\npromotion, namely, dissemination of electricity hype, dissemination of electricity\npromotion by means of wire fraud, and dissemination of false information.  The\nISO has been ordered to disgorge all monies resulting from the improper\nand continuing disclosure of information relating to the California Independent System\nOperator.  The ISO will be in default of all monies resulting from the improper\nand continuing disclosure of information relating to the California Independent System\nOperator.\nPlease contact your FERC/FERCENA/CPUC/CPUC/PX/CCO/CAISO/regulatory/finance/management to discuss
====================
I think that the main reason for the change is the change in the \nintent of the contract.  The intent is that the ECC will not be charged for \nwholesale electricity, but will be a part of the PG&E system.  The \nintent is that the portion of the contract that is currently billed to the \nPublic Utilities Commission will now be billed by Enron as a part of the new \nPGE contract.  I think the intent is to make sure that PG&E pays the \nPublic Utilities Commission a proportionate portion of the contract payments, and \nthat the change in the PG&E contract is not an attempt to gouge the public utility.\n \nPlease let me know if this is acceptable and to provide a revised contract if I \nhave any further questions.\n \nGreg,\nPlease see attached.

The California Independent System Operator (CalISOC) has found that the requested changes to the ISNumber 10 from the previous version do not\napply to it.

The CPUC will then consider whether the\nchanges are necessary and may order the addition of the new ISnumber.\nThe CPUC is required by statute to provide the ISnumber for the entire\nCalifornia Independent System Operator (CAISO) entity.  Because of the\nneed for a separate ISnumber for the entire entity, the CPUC provides the\nISnumber for the entire entity.\nThe Cal ISO is not required to provide the ISnumber for every CAISO\nentity.

The Commission\nrecommends that Member States introduce a\nfinancial incentive package for small business to\nparticipate in the European voluntary credit market.\nUnder the new package, which was adopted on 13 April, small business\nparticipation in the European voluntary credit market will be offered a\nfinancial incentive package equal to 2.5 times the current rate of interest.\nThe Commission\'s decision to introduce the financial incentives\nwas based on the principle that, if the Member State that initiated the\nEuropean\nfirm-to-client relationship with the ISO participated, then the ISO would be\nresponsible for the costs incurred by the ISO in the settlement of the ISO\nrefund claims.  The Commission\'s decision to introduce a\nfinancial incentive package for small business in this context is consistent

The California Attorney General has launched an investigation into whether the state's largest electricity generator, AES Corporation, improperly bundled wholesale electricity prices in the California markets with the intention of artificially inflated wholesale electricity prices.  The purpose of the\narrangements was to gouge the California Power Exchange by withholding wholesale rates from the\nCalifornia Power Exchange's customers and increasing the market value of the wholesale\nelectricity supply.\nBecause AES was a generator of wholesale rates that were artificially inflated and not properly\ncommissioned, the incentive programs were intended to drive up the wholesale rates for\nelectricity generation, resulting in a substantial increase in the wholesale energy price\nheld by the wholesale energy consumer.  Defendants used the California Power\nExchange market to drive up the wholesale rates for wholesale electricity sold in the\nCalifornia markets and to drive up the wholesale prices for wholesale\nenergy imports from the United States.\nApproximately $4.8 billion

The two utilities, which control about 75 \npercent of the power sold in California, have been fighting each other for decades over \nwhether to build interconnect across the state line or to build it on \nits own.  At the 1999 Board of Supervisors meeting, Supervisor Gray \nHensarling (D-Irvine) pressed Interconnection to recognize the two San Diego \nGas and Interconnection companies as "intended customers."  The Interconnection \nCompany would then be entitled to claim its rights to interconnect, and Interconnection \nwould be required to pay the difference between interconnection costs and the \ninterconnection charge itself.

The State of California is in the midst of a major energy crisis, and Governor Davis has called for an emergency meeting of the legislature and the agencies to be called upon to "prepare and implement necessary emergency programs to address the California energy crisis."  The crisis has forced California to rely on private capital investment by utilities and large industrial customers for the supply of power.  California is now the third largest purchaser of wholesale electricity in the United States behind only California and New York.  Approximately $1.6 billion dollars of private investment has been invested thus far in the crisis, and more are expected to come as well.  The crisis has forced the state of California to become the second largest purchaser of wholesale electricity in the United States behind only California and New York.  The crisis has also forced the state of California to become the third largest provider of wholesale electricity in the world behind only New York and Chicago.

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas law requires the state Department of Business and Commerce to turn over real time information about its power customers if it receives a subpoena. \nTexas Attorney General Greg Abbott signed off on the subpoena in April, but has asked the state to wait until after the November election before issuing a subpoena. \nThe state attorney general's office says it will ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to turn over information about power customers it receives when it is served with a subpoena. \nThe request, filed Tuesday in federal court in Houston, requests business and real time data on the state\'s power grid, including daily power output. \nThe request requests information about the names, addresses and phone numbers of the people and businesses to which the subpoena is issued. \nThe state attorney general\'s office says it will ask the FERC to turn over the information, which could include the names, addresses and phone numbers of the people and businesses to whom it is

The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) is concerned about the possible loss of wholesale electricity to SDG&E if the state\'s wholesale power market is not maintained properly.  The CAISO requested the removal of approximately 10% of its wholesale power market to SDG&E in exchange for a 2-year guarantee of 100% reliability.  CAISO counsel requested that the guarantee be suspended until further notice, and that the CAISO be authorized to execute swaps with any power producers that it desires to export to CAISO service areas.  CAISO counsel advised that the swap provisions of the CAISO Swap Agreement with CAISO Dynegy would likely be challenged in the California Court.  The CAISO agreed to suspend the swap until further notice, and requested that the swap provisions of the CAISO Swap Agreement with Dynegy be challenged in the California Court.

In addition, the penalty covers any "unlawful act or omission"\nthat results from the improper management of the system by an unauthorized user.\nAccording to the complaint, CAISO employees failed to exercise due diligence when it came to the\nuse and maintenance of the online trading and distribution systems, which are used to trade\nwholesale products and services across the state.\

The most popular type of coupon is an "index" (the best available index).  The index is a ratio of 10% to 100%, where 100% represents the highest level of quality.  The index is calculated by dividing a company's debt by its EBITDA.  The company with the most coupon codes is the one that has the highest ratio to EBITDA.  The best index is calculated each quarter.  The most popular types of coupon are Index Swap Programs, which are less commonly known, and are more commonly used by marketers.  The Index is calculated by dividing the debt by the total number of visits to the site in a day.  The more visits a company has on its home page, the more exposure that it has to its e-commerce ranking.  The more relevant its ranking on the e-commerce front, the more exposure that it has to its e-commerce ranking.  The more relevant its ranking on the e-commerce front, the more

The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) owes the state of California $1.8 million, according to court documents.  The ISO was operating under an emergency provision in the 1996 Emergency Plan, which the state later enacted.  The state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) authorized the state's Public Utilities Commission to make emergency payments to the ISO if the ISO fails to comply with the provisions of the 1996 Emergency Plan.  The PUC also authorized the state's Emergency Services Commission (ESC) to make emergency payments to the ISO if the ISO fails to comply with the provisions of the 1996 Emergency Plan.  The PUC said in its order for a preliminary injunction enjoining the state from charging excessive rates, that it is "not at liberty to review" the 1996 Emergency Plan provisions because the PUC does not think the 1996 Emergency Plan provisions are relevant to the current situation.

The California legislature passed a law on May 30 that allows the state's attorney general to issue emergency bonds to pay for the costs of the state's power market, which has grown from a $3 billion market in 2000 to more than $4 trillion in today's dollars. The legislature's decision to allow the state's attorney general to issue emergency bonds represents a major step toward ending decades of state government debt bondage. The law, enacted by a Republican-controlled Assembly and signed by Republican President George W. Bush, provides for the creation of a new public debt service, eliminating the need for any private debt service. Under the new law, the state's attorney general will issue $10 billion in emergency bonds to pay for power purchases and other costs that have been passed along to the private sector. Under the new law, the state's attorney general will issue an additional $1 billion in emergency bonds to pay for additional power purchases.

"I think that's why they're so biased." \n- \nI have no problem with the fact that the audit found that the CPUC's cost estimate for 2000-03 was higher than the actual costs.

In the absence of a coordinated effort between the CPUC and the Cities, it is my understanding that the CPUC will not be able to effectively address this issue.  The CPUC will instead focus its efforts on the issue of "appropriate ratepayers" being charged for the power they supply.  This issue has been referred to the "PCE charge."     The CPUC will not be able to address this issue unless the Cities jointly agree to provide the PCE charge to the Cities.      This is a critical issue for the CPUC to address as it will ensure that CPS continues to receive disproportionate rates under the PCE charge.

The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) has been ordered by the state to pay $31 million to the utility after the state refused to renew the contract.\nThe utility, Southern Region of California (SRCD), was supposed to pay the $31 million to the ISO by 30 August, but instead paid the $31 million to the CDWR, who in turn paid the ISO $7 million in interest and penalties on the state\'s balance sheet since the utility never paid the interest.\nThe ISO, which was supposed to be paid on a flat fee, is now fighting the penalty claim.\n"We are extremely frustrated with the state\'s refusal to renew the contract," said Greg Miller, CAISO operations chief.\nThe ISO said the California Public Utilities Commission should order an investigation of the matter, which it said should not interfere with the ability of the state to collect and use its $9 billion in annual revenues.\n"The commission\'s decision

The White House has spent the past week scrambling to explain why the agency charged with collecting and sharing telephone and internet data, voice and text messages and data from customers' e-mail accounts is being charged more than it costs to keep the system running.  The charge reflects the fact that consumers have been hit by sky-high prices and slower internet connections -- a problem that has driven up electricity rates in some areas.  "We've had this charge for years and it's been a problem for us," said Greg Allen, the assistant secretary of the interior.  "We've had this charge for years and it's been a problem for us in parts of the state that are not particularly high rates."  The charge reflects the fact that the rates charged by the state's three largest internet service providers, Southern and Telco, have more than quadrupled, from $143 to $186 per kilowatt hour in just the past month.

The Texas Attorney General has launched an investigation of a pipeline company that supplied natural gas to the state's Department of Water Resources (DWR) under the pressure group program, according to two people familiar with the matter.  The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.  The DWR did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The people said the investigation is focused on whether the pipeline company violated pressure group regulations by supplying natural gas to the state's pressure group during periods when the pressure group was under pressure of 2.7 times the normal load. The people said the company did not respond to requests for comment on the issue.  The state Department of Water Resources does not have specific access to the pressure group during periods when the company was supplying natural gas to the state.

The current state of the market in the energy industry.  This is due to the fact that the ISO is in the midst of a major price and price-control crisis.  Market participants are scrambling to maintain their levels of supply and capacity as prices continue to climb.  Market participants are therefore forced to rely on market participants to maintain their levels of supply and capacity.  The ISO is in the midst of a major crisis because of the continued and persistent failure of the ISO to deliver on its commitments to meet its obligations under the ISO.   The crisis has forced the ISO to default on commitments it made to the markets, including its obligations under the ISO, and has forced it to default on additional commitments it made to the markets, including its obligations under the ISO.  In addition, the crisis has forced the ISO to default on payments it made to the markets in connection with the ISO's operations, including payments that were made but were later later realized by the ISO.

The EES Board of Commissioners is recommending that the ISO and PG&E make formal requests to the utilities to which they belong for an extension of their requested extension of time in order to be paid back to the original purchasers of the power in question.  The request is specifically designed to pay for the replacement of the original retail purchasers of the power.  The request is specific that the extension of time be requested.  The reason for the specific request is that while the original retail purchasers of the power have been compensated in full for the time they spent on the site, the EES Board of Commissioners has determined that it is not in the best interest of the utilities to have the power retained in the retail market for any future payments that may be made to the original retail purchasers.

The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) is one of the largest and most widely used utility in the state.  CAISO contracts contain an extensive set of operating procedures and tariffs that are designed to make it more cost-competitive.  The procedures and tariffs are designed to help ensure that prices are maintained at or above the competitive levels typically reserved for utilities with market power relationships.  CAISO contracts are more commonly referred to as "double-bill" contracts, in that the parties are generally offered a discount when compared to their market rivals.  The double-bill contracts are designed to help ensure that prices are maintained above the cost-of-power bands that are typical for large commercial customers.  In addition, the contracts allow the CAISO to maintain the flexibility to choose its pricing methodology when it comes to the operation and maintenance of its networks.  The Double-Billed Contract was enacted to provide the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) with an opportunity to compete successfully in a number

The CPUC has determined that it is not a party to the existing contract, but a party to the new one.  The CPUC therefore sets the (presumably longer term) target date for its determination for purposes of the new contract.  It does not set the date at which the CPUC will issue its final interim findings.  This is because the CPUC is only notified of the outcome of its investigations and that the interim findings will be communicated to the parties by means of a written notice.   The notice will not contain the full range of the findings and the appropriate mechanism for informing the parties.  The notice will contain the names and addresses of the CPUC's senior staff, and the titles of the CPUC's two independent financial consultants.  The notice will also outline the types of findings and the procedures for informing the parties of the findings.\nThe CPUC will only issue interim findings upon the receipt of the full range of findings and the appropriate mechanism for informing

Enron has been asked by the WSCC to revise its Electricity Quality and Scheduling rules.  Under the new rules, which were approved by the CPUC last week, Enron will no longer be able to buy PJM power from the utilities through its E-Next Generation (EV) business.  Customers who bought power from E-Next before the new rules were adopted will no longer be able to access E-Next by using the utility's new Direct Access program.  Customers who purchased power from E-Next before the new rules were adopted will no longer be eligible for the discounted rate.

Customers who previously paid monthly utility bills will no longer be charged a rate.  The change affects all customers,

The federal government is trying to persuade California to allow it to keep the ISO, which is owned by EES, but has not yet been certified by the ISO as a separate entity.  The ISO is a joint venture of EES and EES California, a utility that is now jointly and severally owned by EES and EES California.  EES California is the only other California utility that is a member of the ISO and has been certified by the ISO as a separate entity.  The ISO has asked the federal government to help it obtain certification by filing a request with the ISO.  \nCalifornia is one of the few states that has not been able to take advantage of the ISO since 1996.  The state is concerned about the possibility of EES California being acquired by EES California and having its utilities qualify for exemption from the ISO.\nCalifornia has long been a leader in the market for distributed generation, but today there is an increasing number of utilities that are competing

The latest round of settlement talks between the parties has been gruelling, with some parties unhappy and others content to wait until the new Administration is in place. But even as the talks draw to a close, the mood is clear that the UK will remain a party to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, with the EU and UK trading on the same continent. "I think we are at the crossroads," said one senior EU official. Mr Cameron has promised to make the UK the "leading trading partner for European goods and services". But even as negotiations progress, the UK government is determined to remain part of the agreement, despite the fact that it is now the second largest trading partner after the EU. "We will continue to work with the UK on trade and investment issues," said a senior EU official. EU leaders will meet next week to finalise a final agreement. With the UK still the only trading partner, it is unlikely that the UK will be forced to leave the EU. But

The City of Houston has asked the Federal Trade Commission to modify its tariff for wholesale electricity, effective April 1, 2001.  The City says that its tariff is based on wholesale prices for electricity for the months of May - September, 2000, when it is serving its retail customers.  Customers of SDG&E retail electricity for that period are not subject to the price change.  Customers of FERC paid an "insufficient price" for electricity delivered in that time period, and therefore, they are "uncompetitive."  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has determined that it is not an "uncompetitive" market, and therefore, it must stay within the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The FERC must now determine whether it is an "uncompetitive" market, and whether it is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. If the FERC finds that it is an "uncompetitive" market, then the City must immediately file a lawsuit challenging the

The state of California has had some success in reducing its electricity consumption, especially in the face of soaring prices.  But it is unclear how successfully California has implemented its new law.  The state Energy Commission, which is expected to issue its final report next month, has yet to identify a specific method of eliminating consumption.  The state is expected to rely heavily on new generation, which could be very expensive for some households.  In addition, some analysts expect California to continue to face an ever-increasing energy bill, which could push up prices.  "It's not a question of just cutting back," said Andy Brown, director of the California Independent System Operator.  "The problem is, it's going to continue to get worse."  In addition, some analysts expect California to continue to see new power plants opening in the coming years.  "It's going to get worse," said Brown.  "It's going to get worse."

The European Commission (EC) has ruled that it cannot charge a 3% premium to wholesale electricity prices in the UK.  EC law requires wholesale prices to remain at the "competitive" 25% to 30% mark-to-market until prices in that market have fallen by more than 10% from their levels in the summer of 2000.  The Commission said that because prices in that market have fallen by more than 10% from the levels immediately preceding the financial crisis, it cannot charge a premium to wholesale electricity prices.  The decision, which will likely come as a shock to some retail customers, comes as a big shock to the power industry.  EC Commissioner Viviane Reding said that the decision was "unconscionable".  EC Commissioner for markets Maria Miller said that the decision was "unconscionable".  EC Commissioner for markets Maureen McFadden said that the decision was "unconscionable".

The Sun Sentinel reports that the state Department of Water Resources (DWR) is "looking into" the possibility that some of its power plants may have been improperly converted into "cleaner fuels" by California's PG&E and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) subsidiary.  The utilities, which control about 70% of California\'s power generation, have long been accused of using sophisticated marketplaces to maximize supply and maximize demand.  The lawsuits and investigations have focused on whether the state deregulated utilities improperly sold natural gas to generators and traders in the wholesale market, as well as to California\'s wholesale power market participants, PEG and PG&E.\nIn December 2000, the state\'s three largest power producers, Southern California Edison, Southern California Gas and PG&E, jointly controlled 86% of the wholesale electricity supply in the state, according to state records.\nThe utilities, which control about 70% of California\'s power generation and control

The Energy Department has agreed to implement a $1.2 billion increase to the state's meter and wire fraud charges as part of a broader package of actions by the agency to control "market manipulation" and ensure that rates are "competitive" across the system.  The announcement was made last week by DOE Commissioner John S. Gray, who said that the agency would implement a $1 billion increase to the state's meter and wire fraud charges as part of a broader package of actions by the agency to control "market manipulation" and ensure that rates are "competitive" across the system.  The announcement was made by Governor Gray in a statement on Monday.  "The state of California is committed to working with all parties to the negotiations to ensure the successful implementation of the Governor's initiatives to reduce rates and bring down the California electricity price," Governor Gray said.  Gray said that the increase would "help restore confidence in the market."  "The key to restoring confidence is to have the necessary tools

The California Department of Water Resources (DWR) is using a generator contract to price a power purchase contract (PPA) that it purchased from a utility in California.  The PPA is to be delivered in the second quarter of 2001.  The price is set by the DWR Board of Commissioners.  The price is set based on a market-based pricing model developed by the California Independent System Operator.  The market-based pricing model was developed to provide a mechanism by which the DWR could discount its wholesale prices by using market-based pricing.  The DWR Board of Commissioners will consider the implementation of this mechanism on December 15, 2001.  The implementation of this mechanism will require the DWR to develop and implement a cost-competitive pricing model.

The price of gas spiked sharply this week as markets closed for the fourth-straight week, according to data from North Carolina Public Radio. The utility said Tuesday it would cut its wholesale price to $.94 by Friday, as markets closed for the fifth-straight week. The price hike prompted Gov. Pat McCrory to announce a crackdown on wholesale prices amid a string of power price hikes this week. "We are seeing a concerted effort by the industry to try and gouge consumers," said Kevin Bresnahan, North Carolina Department of Natural Resources spokesman. "The governor's order is a clear message to the generators and traders that they can continue to reap huge profits from wholesale electricity prices." A generator that delivers electricity to the state's eight largest power plants reported Tuesday that they were cutting back on electricity to them after receiving a $2 billion reward from the state. The state Department of Natural Resources said Tuesday it would close eight of its nine power plants next week, including one that supplies electricity

A group of researchers from the University of California, Davis, have developed a model that can estimate the cost and benefit of new transmission systems in the short term (i.e., five years), based on the current state of the energy markets.  The model was developed to estimate the cost and benefit of new transmission systems in the short term, based on the current state of the energy markets.  The primary outcome of the modeling exercise is the estimate of the cost and benefit of new transmission systems in the short term.  The model indicates that the cost and benefit estimates for new transmission systems in the current period will be significantly less than the cost and benefit estimates for the periods in which the system was initially installed.  The cost and benefit estimates for the five years in which the system was initially installed will be significantly less than the cost and benefit estimates for the periods in which the system was initially shared with other systems.\nThe cost and benefit estimates for the new transmission systems in the current period
