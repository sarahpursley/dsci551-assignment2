TRUST TRANSACTION Dear Sir, A Very Good day to you    I am Mrs Mariam Abacha. I got your contact from a close Associate of mine who works with the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry  who visited your country for an International Trade Fair upon my quest for a trusted and reliable foreign businessman or company.  He however gave me the assurance that you can be trusted to handle a transaction of this magnitude. Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani Abacha the late Former Head of State of Nigeria in 1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness  by the present civilian administration, I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country.  As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many outright blackmail. In fact the total sum discovered by  the Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I will give you more information  as to this regard as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you due to security network placed on my day to day  affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have deposited  the sum of US$35 million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communication. I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safekeeping. This arrangement is known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal directly with you as I am still under house arrest. I am seriously considering to settle down abroad as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start all over again if only you wish, but if it is possible,  just help me in diverting this funds into your bank account which will accrue you 20% of this fund. Please honesty is the watchword in this transaction. And should you accept my terms, kindly send me an email signifying your interest to my email box as this is only safe for me now so that we can commence  communication immediately. And upon receipt of your message of interest, I shall give you a more detailed picture of things. In case you don't accept please do not let me out to the security as I am giving you this information in total trust and confidence.NO RISK IS INVOLVED AS IAM STILL IN CONTROL OF MY HUSBANDS AFFAIRS. I will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith.  Please expedite action.

I am Mr George Mboro , a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (US$18,500,000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount (US$18.5m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30% of the US$18.5 million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hind! rance to the successful execution of this transaction.  I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above tel/fax number ,or my email address:mboro@accountant.com whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me contact other another Foreign partner with recommendation to carry out this deal. I want to assure you that myself and my partners are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and Please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter; because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.  I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. I am available to entertain any questions concerning the clarity of this transaction.  Yours faithfully, Mr  George  Mboro
URGENT BUSINESS TRUSTEE TRANSFER OF USD$22MILLION INTO YOUR ACCOUNT} ATTENTION: President\CEO. I, on behalf of my other colleagues from different organs of Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as regards transfer of the above-mentioned amount into your bank account.  This fund accrued from over invoicing of various contract awarded in my parastatal to certain Foreign Contractors sometimes ago. We, as holders of sensitive position in our various parastatals, were mandated by the Federal Government to Scrutinise all payments made to certain foreign Contractors and we discovered that some of the contracts they executed were grossly over-invoiced either by omission or commission.  In the process the sum of US$27M (Twenty Seven Million US Dollars only) was found lying in the parastatal suspense account after the foreign contractors had been paid their rightful dues for executing the said contracts. We all agreed that this over-invoiced amount be transferred (for our own use) into a bank account provided by a foreign partner, because we are government workers and the Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate foreign accounts. However, we have succeeded in transferring some of this money precisely US$5.0M (Five Million US Dollars only) into a foreign account in MOROCCO (North Africa), but the provider of the account in MOROCCO is up to some mischief and refuses to comply to the earlier mutual agreement by insisting that the total amount be paid into his nominated bank account before disbursement will take effect.  If for a meagre sum of US$5.0M (Five Million US Dollars only) we are not compensated, is it when the balance of US$22M (Twenty-two Million US Dollars)is transferred that we will be sure of our full compensation? Of course, this abuse of trust and inhumanity calls for sober reflection and search for absolute trust. Thus we are seeking your unwavering assistance that the remaining amount of US$22M can be speedily processed and fully remitted into your nominated bank account.  On successful remittance of the fund into your account, you will be compensated with 30% of the amount for your assistance and services. So far, much have been said and due to our sensitive positions, we cannot afford a slip in this transaction neither can we give out identity as regards our respective offices, but whereby cordial relationship is established, smooth operations commences, you will be furnished with details of all you deserves to know. I am at your disposition to entertain any question from you with respect to this transaction, so contact me immediately through my e:mail for further information on the requirements and procedure for this transaction. Please, treat with the strictest confidentiality and utmost urgency. Yours faithfully, MR FRED OBI.

On the 6th of June 1998 an American miner, Mr. Travis Myers ran an account with us and his present balance is valued at US$28,500,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States  Dollars Only) in my Bank. We sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally, we discovered from his employers that he died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, we found out from his account file that he never made a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless, as he had none. We therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Travis Myers did not  declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents in the bank files. This sum of $28,500,000.00 is still  lying in the bank and the principal sum and interest is being rolled over at the end of every year. As it is now, no one  will ever come forward to claim this money. According to the Nigeria law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money  will revert to the ownership of the Government if unclaimed.  Consequently, my proposal is that I would like you to stand in as the next of kin of Mr. Travis Myers. This is simple; all  we need is some of your details so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which would put you in place as Mr. Myers's next of kin. We shall also employ the services of an accredited Attorney for the drafting and notarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letters of probate/administration in your  favour for the transfer. The money would be shared in the ration of 75% for us and 25% for you. There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as a manager  guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via email. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for us. I shall  still require your assistance to invest my own share in your country just incase you can help, otherwise we'll take our  share .  Awaiting your urgent reply. Mr.Dayo Naps 234 80 372 20807

INVESTMENT ASSISTANCE INVESTMENT ASSISTANCE.  I am Mr Chuks Anthony, the financial Controller and Contract Award Committee Chairman  in the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) in Lagos, Nigeria. My colleagues have  assigned me to seek for assistance of a reliable foreigner through whom we can transfer the  sum of US $65,500,000.00 (sixty Five Million, five Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) which  arose from deliberate over- inflated contract value for the General expansion of the Kanji  Dam Thermal Station on behalf of National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) for increased  energy generation to Nigeria and some other West African Countries. The Contract was  awarded in 1998 during the late General Sanni Abacha regime to an expatriate firm with the  consideration of 10% commission agreement on the total contract value. The contract has  been completed and the contractor has long been paid, we are now left with this  US$65,500,000.00 representing the 10% our own share as agreed presently in the Federal  Government account. The favorable political/economic climate in this country now presented  an opportunity for this money to be transferred out of the country. I got your contact from a  commercial attached to your emabassy. This assurance gave me courage to link you up for  this particular transaction, and I hope it will be of mutual benefit to all of us. Our contact in  the Federal Ministry of Finance have given us a go a head advice to begin the process of the  remittance, hence we have set in motion the machinery for the take off of the transaction and  further action will commence immediately we hear from you. We have agreed that after the  transfer of the money into your account, you shall be entitled to 30% of the total amount  transferred, 10% for incidental expenses from you and us, while the remaining 60% will be  for us. We decided to give you this percentage in order to motivate you and also to let you  feel satisfied at the end of this transaction. The nature of your business is not particularly  relevant for the success of this transaction. All we require is your willingness to co-operate  and assurance that our own share will be given to us when this money is transferred into your  account. All necessary precautions have been taken to ensure a no risk situation on the sides  of both parties and it is believed that the conclusion of this transaction will not last more than  fourteen (14) working days. However, we are going to retrieve the whole documents that will  be related to this transaction so that both parties will be protected after the transfer of the  money into your account. Since we have no knowledge of business, our plan is to invest this  money into Real Estate, Stocks and we can also invest in some other profitable business in  your country based on your advice because many of our years has been spent as Civil  Servant, and we may likely resign from government service to private businesses after this  money is transferred into your Account. Please note that this business is strictly confidential  and must not be disclosed to a third party. This is necessary to avoid disclosure that may  jeopardize the transaction. Finally, if this proposal is acceptable to you or if you have any  questions, feel free to contact me on the above E-mail address.

BUSINESS PROPOSAL PLEASE TREAT AS ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENTIAL  FROM THE DESK OF JOHNSON ELENDU.  AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT.  FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.  UNION BANK PLC.  REPLY STRICTLY VIA: [jelendu2@indiatimes.com] Attn: sir,  Permit me to introduce myself to you, My name is Johnson Elendu., I am one of the Senior Managers in the bank I work for (Union Bank, Nigeria PLC) and I work under the Director of Foreign Exchange Operations (International Remittance). I am contacting You presently because I need your urgent assistance in a business transaction that will be of immense benefit to both of us.  I have the immediate need to transfer some money that has long been  declared "UNCLAIMED" by the chairman and some members of the board of  directors of our bank. The money is the closing balance of one of our best customers ever, Late Engr. Manfred Becker, I was his personal account officer just before he died in the ADC plane crash of 1996 in Nigeria.  Engr. Manfred Becker an American citizen was a contractor with the  Federal Government of Nigeria, he supplied and installed equipment and his company Creek land Contractors completed some of the best construction contracts in the country. His closing balance in the Bank, Union Bank of Nigeria PLC (US$40.Million) has been tagged Unclaimed because no relative of Engr. Becker has come forward to make a statement of claim. We have no knowledge of a next of kin. At this point I trust you can picture what the situation is like. We have strong proof that the chairman and the board of directors will keep most of the money for themselves and donate the remainder to a discredited military trust here in Nigeria. This invariably  is an attempt to infuse more money into the acquisition of military  equipment (arms and ammunition) for use in an already prostrate Africa.  This of course, is senseless, hence my mission.  My colleagues and my self have made several attempts at locating  persons that could be remotely related to Engr. Becker and we have been doing this  for about 4 years now. Right now I am almost alone in this enterprise and I have presently decided on moving the money to a foreign account. I am hereby soliciting your assistance and I will be very grateful if you will be willing to help in this regard.  We have access to most of what it will take to transfer the money. The only thing we do not have is a safe account. We will provide you with answers to all the security questions, which you will have to answer to move the process towards completion. We will also provide you answers to questions that only a person related to him will know. You may however not need to make any appearance; every thing will be concluded on phone and email between you and the bank [UNION BANK NIGERIA PLC, LAGOS] for your participation you will get 30%, 5% has been earmarked for the expenses that may be incurred on both ends. 65%shall be for my colleague and I.  I make this proposal in trust and in good faith, therefore, if you are interested and you agree to assist me then contact me immediately you receive this email, there is a lot more to talk about. If you are not interested, then, please, do get rid of this email and please forgive me if this message has upset you in any way.  Thank you and best regards.

GOODDAY SIR       GOODDAY SIR I AM MISS SUSSY  PLEASE DO REPLY THIS E-MAIL THROUGH MY PRIVATE EMAIL ADDRESS FOR  SECURITY REASONS: e.sussy@caramail.com Dear  Good thing to write you. I have a proposal for you-this however is not mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to honour against your will.  Your profile pushed me to send you this mail,I am Sussy Emma and the only  daughter of our late parents Mr.and Mrs.Emma with my junior brother Kelly. our  father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated  in the capital of Ivory coast during his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his  business trips abroad year 12th.Febuary 2002.Though his sudden death was  linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who  travelled with him at that time.But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 10 years old,and sin  ce then my father took me  and my junior brother so special. Before his death on Febuary 12 2002 he  called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him that he has  the sum of ten million,seven hundred thousand United State Dollars. (USD$10.700,000) left in one of the leading security company here in Abidjan  Ivroy coast West Africa.  He further told him that he deposited the money in my name,and finally issued a  written instruction to his lawyer whom he said is in possession of all the necessary  but legal documents to this fund and the security company .

PLEASE GET BACK TO ME URGENTLY Dear Good Friend,           REQUEST FOR URGENT ASSISTANCE.  This business proposal to you is strictly confidential, with due  respect. Sorry at this perceived confusion or stress you may have receiving this  letter from me, Since we have not known ourselves or met previously.  Despite that, I am constrained to write you this letter because of the  urgency it requires.As amatter of fact, I got your contact through the internet and decided to write you immediately believing you will be of a great assistance to my kids and me.  My decision to consult you for a partnership business of mutual benefit is indeed personal.Iam not in doubt that you can be trusted in financial related matters of this magnitude.   I am Mrs.cecilia aku, the widow of the former nigeria youth and sports minister late mark Ishaya Aku who died in a plane crash on the 4th of april,2002 My kids and I are trapped in an obnoxious custom And traditional rites of my late husband's family.  We have suffered maltreatment and untold hardship in the hands of my  late husbands family, simple because Iam not from the same tribe with my late husband.His brothers have taken all that I suffered with  my husband to acquire including treasure, houses and his bank accounts  closed by them. I wanted to escape to the United States of America [USA} with my children on exile, but again they conspired and stole my international passport and other traveling document to further frustrate me. Thank God, a week ago, I received  Key Text Code (KTC} from an offshore payment center[OPC]in overseas via our family lawyer that my late husband deposited the sum of U.S $15.7 Million[Fifteen Million Seven Hundred Thousand United States Dollars] in cash with this company,hence my late husband's brothers would not allow me to have any telephone contact with anybody.  It has therefore, become very necessary and urgent to contact someone,  a foreigner like you who can travel to the offshore payment center on  our behalf to help me  receive/secure these funds and to help invest it on our behalf as well,  while we find a way of getting out to meet with you in your country.  These funds are kept on a CODE with the Security Company to avoid  detection,  seizure or diversion. I have had several discussions with with our family lawyer who has express willingness to help me with the necessary documents for the claim of the funds from the security company should I get an honest,competent and capable foreigner who will not cheat my kids and me or even sit on the funds after claiming it, to stand on our behalf to claim the funds. This is why I have contacted you to help save my children and I from this obnoxious tax levelled on us by my late husbund's brothers by claiming these funds and investing it  on our behalf.  But, you would need to give me sufficient assurance that if you help  me, you would not divert the funds. My children and I have resolved to  give you 20% of the total sum. This is all my children and I have got  to live on. Please, I have reposed my confidence and trust in you and hope you will not disappoint me.  I will forward you the contact of our family lawyer for you  to get in touch with him immediately hence he will be the one to deal with you on the transaction to avoid suspicion from my late husband's brothers.  I look forward to your urgent response.  THANKS AND God bless.  Mrs.cecilia aku

please reply From:Mr.Philip Jones.  (Executive Manager)  Private Tel/Fax: 234-1-7598296  Private E-mail: philjones1@uboot.com  Dear Sir,  I am Mr. Philip jones, an official with one of the APEX  banks in Nigeria.My colleagues and I have an urgent  and very confidential  business proposal for you. On the 6th of June 1998 an  American miner, Mr. Travis Myers ran an account with  us and his present balance is valued at  US$28,500,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million, Five Hundred  Thousand United States Dollars Only) in my Bank. We  sent a routine notification to his forwarding address  but got no reply. After a month, we  sent a reminder and finally, we discovered from his  employers that he died from an automobile accident. On  further investigation, we found out from his account  file that he never made a will and all attempts to  trace his next of kin was fruitless, as he had none.  We therefore made further investigations and  discovered that Mr. Travis Myers did not declare any  next of kin or relations in all his official documents  in the bank files. This sum of $28,500,000.00 is still  lying in the bank and the principal sum and interest  is being rolled over at the end of every year. As it  is now, no one will ever come forward to claim this  money. According to the Nigeria law, at the expiration  of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the  ownership of the Government if unclaimed.  Consequently, my proposal is that I would like you  to stand in as the next of kin of Mr. Travis Myers.  This is simple; all we need is some of your details so  that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents  and affidavits which would put you in place as Mr.  Myers's next of kin. We shall also employ the services  of an accredited Attorney for the drafting and  notarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary  documents and letters of probate/administration in  your favour for the transfer. The money would be  shared in the ration of 75% for us and 25% for you.  There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this  transaction will be done by the Attorney and my  position as a manager guarantees the successful  execution of this transaction. If you are interested,  please reply immediately via email.  Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest  assured that this transaction would be most profitable  for us. I shall still require your assistance to  invest my own share in your country just incase you  can help, otherwise we'll take our share .  Awaiting your urgent reply,  Mr.Philip Jones. 
Important Business Proposition Dear Sir/Madam,  I am writting this letter out of a genuine desperation to find a reliable partner in the unfolding transaction.I have been unjustly treated by my partner in a transaction so,I seek your help, attention and genuine co-operation to our mutual benefit and  i believe that you will not let down the trust and confidence i am about to repose on you.  I am MR.FRED OBI,from NIGERIA and for the past ten years,I have been working in a public Relations firm that pays me about 100 hundred dollars each month. On the 30th of june,our company made a very big financial breakthrough when we made contact with ALHAJI DAN MUSA. We began to supply him his cow vaccine named LIM KXT COW VACCINE. ALHAJI DAN MUSA is THE PRESIDENT OF (WICDEL GROUP COMPANY )He is a millionaire farmer with CATTLE FARMS in all part of AFRICA , and a new one located at ABIDJAN COTE D'VOIRE.  Moreover, he is the greatest supplier of cattle beef and other dairy products to the whole of West Africa.HE had informed us about the huge amount of money he spends on the purchase of a particular but very important cattle medicine. Precisely, he buys U  S$5,000 per carton. He asked if our organisation can source for a cheaper supplier.  We did market research and discovered that we can buy these vaccine in Europe for US$2,000 per carton. We moved a proposal to WICDEL GROUP COMPANY, to supply him at US$4,800 per carton which they accepted. As these supplies progressed and our company is  doing fine,I requested to my boss for an increase in our salary.he was so upset that he sacked me without benefits and ten years of dedicated workmanship.  I was so desperate that I went to the WICDEL GROUP COMPANY farms and infomed ALHAJI DAN MUSA that I have a foriegn contact that will be willing to supply him this same products at US$4,400. Per carton. ALHAJI DAN MUSA in turn confided to me that he is about to place order for one thousand cartons following a suspected outbreak of disease in his farms.I asured ALHAJI DAN MUSA that my foreing contact will be in the position to manufacture and supply to him,infact I convinced him that my former boss usually buy from my foriegn contact and that is why he sales to him at a higher price. HOWEVER,I INFORMED ALHAJI DAN MUSA THAT HE WILL HAVE TO PAY CASH IN ADVANCE BEFORE MY FORIEGN CONTACT WILL SUPPLY TO HIM. For the moment he has stopped all contact with my boss.  Please consider on how to handle this profitable project and kindly contact me immediately through my private e-mail: fredobi@indiatimes.com  for more details and negotiations as regards my commission.However,I will insist that my commission will be 20% of the total profit.  Note : We will buy one thousand carton at US$2,000,000. We sell to them at US$4,400,000 Dollars, our client pays cash before lifting of the goods. (They must not know our purchase point in (Europe).  Thanks and God bless you.  Mr.FRED OBI  Tel: 234-80-332 96219  Fax: 234-1-7592758

CRY FOR HELP Dear Sir,  Difficulties encountered in efforts to establish a business abroad  necessitate  this search for someone to assist me in securing and investing the sum of  USD21,000.000 (twenty one million  dollars)inherited from my father's  business  reserve.  I am the heir of a Zimbabwean family; my father was an agriculturist. He  became  rich from his old-aged investment in agriculture and later was victimized by  President Robert Mugabe's land reform policy. He was assassinated by unknown  gunmen for defending his land ownership and siding the minority white  farmers.  Before his death, my father foresaw the insecurity of both our lives and  property then decided to deposit the above sum with a private finance and  security firm in Europe. This money has become the only inherited property  of  our family since our home was burnt,and the farmlands and machines seized;  yet  the government and it's loyalists are bent on making life difficult for us.  To summarise this traumatic story, my mother and I have decided to offer 15%   of  the above sum to anyone who assists us to secure this funds overseas or 25%  share for possible help on investing in any reliable venture.  There are however some minimal cost involved in securing the release of this  deposit from the present holding company.i do not intend to overburden you  with  these cost.but you must know beforehand that we will be sharing whatever  cost  involved in retrieving this deposit and putting it to beneficial use.  if you would want to proceed under these terms,please reply for detailed  information. if you do not accept my offer,please in good fate treat with  utmost  confidentiality .

Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance  unclaimed.  Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain good relations with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies.

THANKS Dear Sir, Difficulties encountered in efforts to establish a business abroad necessitate this search for someone to assist me in securing and investing the sum of USD22,000.000 (twenty two million dollars)inherited from my father's business reserve. I am the heir of a Zimbabwean family.my father was an agriculturist. He became rich from his old-aged investment in agriculture and later was victimized by President Robert Mugabe's land reform policy. He was assassinated by unknown gunmen for defending his land ownership and siding the minority white farmers. Before his death, my father foresaw the insecurity of both our lives and property and decided to deposit the above sum with a private finance and security firm in Europe. This money has become the only inherited property of our family since our home was burnt and the farmlands and machines seized;yet the government and it's loyalists are bent on making life difficult for us. To summarise this traumatic story, my mother and I have decided to offer 25% of the above sum to anyone who assists us to secure this funds overseas or 35% share for possible help on investing in any reliable venture. if you would want to proceed under these terms,please reply for detailed information. if you do not accept my offer, in good fate treat with utmost confidentiality . A quick reply with your name,telephone and fax numbers for more confidential communication will be highly appreciated. Sincerely yours, DANDLA NGUBE

Please could you be of help. My dear good friend,  I write to you as the Head of Securities & Investment of First National Bank of South Africa, Cape Town branch with the intention of seeking your assistance in completing a simple in testate transaction.  Sometime in June of 2001, a customer of our bank with the South African Mining Corporation, made a timed-Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$11,250,000.00 [Eleven million, two hundred & fifty thousand US dollars] in my branch.  Upon maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  Additional inquiries revealed that he died of an automobile accident without making any WILL.  There was no next of kin or relations to be traced.  The above stated amount is still sitting in our bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5[five] years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Accordingly, I will like you to stand in as the next of kin so that the fruits of our customers labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple? Would you be kind enough to do it for us?  The management of our bank is well in support of this email.  There are relatively no risks to you.  The money will be paid into your account.

I apologize if this is not acceptable to you.  The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a  Business venture i intend to go into as soon as i get out this funds.  Due to the land and political problems in Zimbabwe, and President Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black farmers,all white farmers were asked to surrender their farms to the government for re-distribution and infact to his political party members and my father though black was the treasury of the farmers  association and a strong Member of an opposition party that did not support the president's idea.  He then ordered his party members and the police under his pay row to  Invade my father's farm and burn down everything in the farm. They Killed my father and took away a lot of items from his farm.  After the death of my father, our local pastor and a close friend of my  Father Reverened Theophilus Nnamni ,handed us over will documents with instructions from my father That we should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him.  The will documents have a certificate of deposit, Airway bill confirming cash Deposit totalling Twelve million five hundred thousand united state  dollars. [$12.5m] kept in custody for us in a security company unknown to  the company (BRITISH INVESTMENT TRUST SECURITY COMPANY (NETHERLANDS)  that the content is money hence it was deposited as PERSONAL BELONGINGS.

Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum Seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial Transaction, this is why I am seeking a genuine and reliable Partner and friend, whose account this money can be transferred after the consignment,hence your involvement in this venture.and that would be with the assistance of Advocate Smith.E.Fevinn  who has his chambers in DEN HAGG,in the NETHERLANDS who has agreed to stand by me till my funds is released, after hearing all my ordeal and verifying my claims from the security company.  You have to understand that this decision taken by me is a very big  And brave one, and it entrusts my future in your hands, as a result of  the safe keeping of this money.

HOW ARE YOU TODAY? FROM MR FRED KUMA. REPUBLIC OF BENIN. WEST AFRICA. TEL:229 08 69 05. Dear Friend, I am MR FRED KUMA, the director in charge of auditing and accounting section of Continental Trust Bank cotonou republic of benin in west Africa with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of  us at the end of the transaction . During our investigation and auditing in this bank,my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash on the 26th December 1998 on airline transafrik International with aircraft Lockheed L-100-30 at location Vila Nova,Angola with registration number S9-CAO and since his untimely death the funds has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development. Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself and partners to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amount was US$24.1M (Twenty Four million One Hundred Thousand united states dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through my a friends who works with the Ministry of Information here in Cotonou-Benin. It is him who recommended your person to me to be viable and capable to champion a business of such magnitude without any problem. Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased,get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit yourself to this great business opportunity. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant,we  are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designated bank account. May I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as I have made arrangements for a successful arrangement as an insider of the bank before contacting you.  On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone bills, while 60% will be for me and my partners. Please, you have been adviced to keep this a top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary information will be sent to you on your acceptance to champion this transaction with me. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible on my personal mobile phone 229 08 69 05 stating your wish in this deal. Yours faithfully, DR FRED KUMA TEL:229 08 69 05.

Though, I don't know to what extent you are familiar with events and disturbances in Sierra-Leone but it had consistent features in the BBC, CNN news bulletins. The pressure of war drove my family out of Sierra-Leone into exile in Spain where we have been living under political asylum for three years. Sadly, my mother died of cancer 4 months ago and was buried in Madrid. Prior to her death, she gave me a certificate of a secret deposit that my father made in a security company in Europe (destination will be disclosed later for security reasons) The money $45,000,000.00 (forty-five million dollars) was deposited as family treasure. He did this with a view to converting it to his personal use at the end of the war but was killed as a result of his opposition to the rebel forces when the conflict intensified. I have however  contacted the security company to confirm the deposit and establish ownership. Due to the death of my mother and the continued hostility in Sierra-Leone, I have decided to solicit the assistance of an honest and trustworthy person or company that will assist in investing the money. I cannot do it alone due to my present political status and total ignorance of the business world. You will be given a negotiable percentage of the money at the end of the transaction. If you are honest, trustworthy and interested in the above proposal, contact me immediately through my email address for more details. You must maintain absolute confidentiality in order to ensure success. Please, indicate your personal telephone/fax numbers when replying. Best Regards, Thomas Sesay Karimu.  
FOR A MUTUAL BUSINESS BENEFIT FROM THE DESK OF  DR. HASSAN DIKO  N N P C.  EMAIL: hassandiko@fsmail.net  MUTUAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP-STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.  I am Dr. HASSAN DIKO,the chief accountant of The Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and I head a five man tender board in charge of contract award and payment approvals.I came to know of you in my search for a reliable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.  There were series of contracts executed by a consortion of  multinationals in the oil industry in favour of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) among which were for the following:  1. The expansion of the pipelines network within for a crude down stream products distribution and subsequent evacuation which cost $8bUSD(8 Billion United States Dollars).  2. Contract for the turn around maintenance (TAM) of the various refineries in the country $115 million Uited States Dollars.  . The construction of storage tanks for petrolwum products (depots) $190 Million United States Dollars.  The original value of these contracts were delebrately over invoiced in the sum $69mUSD (sixty nine Million United States Dollars Only) which has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred, being that the companies that actually executed these contracts had been fully paid when the projests were officially commissioned.  It does not matter whether your comapny did the contract or not, the assumption is that your company won the major contract and sub-contracted it out to other companies.  Consequently, my colleaques and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil service laws) from opening and or operating foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust imposed on you at this junction is  enormous.  In return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 5% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between the parties in the course of the transaction, and the remaining 75% is for us,the Nigerian officials.  Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the fund within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms.  Our assurance is that your role is risk free,I accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the fund,the whole approval procedures will be officially and legally processed with the name of any company you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary of the above mentioned amount.  Therefore, when the business is successfully concluded we shall through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the concerned government ministries for 100% security risk free.  Once more, I want you to understand that having put in over 19 years in the civil service of my country, I am very careful to have my image and career deemed.  Please contact me immediately through E-mail whether you are interested in this deal or not, if you are not, it will enable us scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal but where you are interested send the required documents.  Send by Email for security reasons.  Thanks as I await in anticipation for your fullest co-operation.  Very truly yours,  Dr. HASSAN DIKO  PLEASE NOTE:Send your reply to my confidencial email addres(hassandiko@hknetmail.com) 
TRUSTED PARTNER. Dear Friend,  Greetings!!  I come to you with a sincere heart believing in Almighty Allah that you will consider my plight and come to help and also benefit from me.  I am Mrs. Amina Mohammed, cousin and Personal Assistant to former Nigeria Head of State, Late General Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th July 1998 while in power. Before I proceed please accept my apology for the embarrassment this mail might cause you for coming from a total stranger who you do not know. Actually I got your contact from the Internet; please do not feel bad about it because I am compelled to reach you due to urgent need to safeguard the money in question. Once again, forgive me and come to my aid. Please read the following carefully.  Sometime in early 1997, my boss late Gen. Sanni Abacha entrusted to me the sum of US$20.5M in cash (Twenty million, five hundred thousand US dollars) due to the trust and confidence he had in me. This money was meant for campaign in is self-succession bid but unfortunately he suddenly died before actualization of his aspiration. This amount of $20.5M in CASH was deposited with a security company, which I will disclose in subsequent mail in a giant trunk box as diplomatic consignments In agreement with Mr.Mohammed Abacha who is the son of Late General Abacha and the heir to the money. I write to solicit your Assistance for the money to be transferred to your custody. Note that Mr.Mohammed Abacha is currently in detention by the present Nigeria Government for reasons linked to activities of his father when he was in power. Now based on the business trust I have on you, I would want you to come forward and receive this consignment containing the !   money in cash on our behalf from the security company for subsequent disbursement between you and us. Understand that we are soliciting your assistance because the present Nigerian Government is seizing/freezing any Bank Account or valuables belonging to the late Head of State's family and relatives. Infact we do not have enough money now to sustain our family so, I will appreciate if you can consider our plight and assist us.For your assistance, we have agreed to compensate you with 20% of the total amount ($20.5) while the remaining 80% is for us. We hope to invest part of our share in your country on viable area of investment as you may advise us.  If you are interested you will need to visit the Security Company for clearance of the consignment. I assure you that the transaction is 100% risk free. Please I implore you to keep this transaction absolutely secret against negative exposure. I would want you to contact me immediately so that we can proceed with the business.

NEXT OF KIN /PATNERSHIP NIGERIAN TELECOMMUNICATION LIMITED. FEDERAL SECRETARIAT COMPLEX, GARKI, ZONE II ABUJA. E-MAIL: kendikko01@123.com DATE:13th Oct. 2003                                                               REF:rf/ntl-fgn Dear Friend, Please do not be disturbed about this mail as I am contacting you for the first time through this medium,  while nursing no doubts that you will be of great  assistance to this business proposal  I am about  disclosing to you for our both mutual benefit. I am Dr. Ken Dikko, the Project Director of Nitel at the above address. Following my intentions of owning an offshore investment, I was urged to  contact a foreigner  to assist in facilitating the  immediate release  of $14Million United States Dollars into his/her bank account to jointly execute my motive of securing  an offshore  investment. This was because Nigeria's  civil service code of conduct does  not allow a civil  servant to own an offshore account or investment outside the shores of Nigeria. Sequel to this, I was able to contact a foreigner (Mr. Jim Walsh) an American based in Nigeria to assist  with the transfer.  He agreed and we  proceeded  in procuring all documents necessary to  facilitate the  immediate release of the funds into his custody using him as a Project Consultant to the Nigerian  Telecommunication. The money was as a result of an over-invoiced contract on contract  number "ntl-fgn01/ped-98" for the  procurement, supply  and installation of  Telecommunication equipment to Nitel regional offices up to the tune of $52Million United States Dollars.  It was awarded to a  Swiss Contractor who executed  the contract and was fully paid i.e $38Million United  States Dollars leaving aside $14Million United States Dollars. Final payment approval was granted on behalf of Mr. Jim Walsh by the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF)  to the paying bank while waiting for the payment  application from him to the bank but he suddenly died of Cardiac Arrest leaving no  Next of kin/beneficiary to the funds. It is as a result of this, that I am contacting  you to  please stand as the next of kin to Mr.  Jim Walsh and new beneficiary  to the funds to  enable the funds to be transfered into your custody. All documents to back up your claim will be giving  to you adequately  while a Memorandum of  Understanding (MOU) will be reached between us to safe guard our both interest in line of this transaction. I am willing to compensate you with 25% of the total funds while the rest 75% will be for me for the  investments in your country as well as assuring  you that this transaction is 100% risk free and legal. If this proposal is okay to you, please kindly get back to me to enable  me demand certain informations  and briefing for the commencement of this transaction. Please always quote the reference number above in all correspondences to me while confidentiality should be  our watch word. I await your urgent response. Sincere regards, Dr. Ken Dikko. Project Director, Nitel. ____________________________________________________________ Charle con sus amigos online usando CHAT 123 http://www.123.com/sp/chat/section.php?id_section=329

CAN I TRUST YOU WITH THIS BUSINESS? Greetings from UAE  HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL.  I decided to contact you by email because I feel that it is more secured and private. I am Nasser Bin Nasiri, Director of Procurement and Contract Award with, Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources [MPMR]. I am contacting you concerning the transfer of US$43 Million Dollars (FOURTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS)  Sometime ago, a contract was awarded by my Corporation, [MPMR] to a Japanese Firm, to carry out Turn Around Maintenance and rehabilitation work on Emirates Petroleum Products Company (EPPCO) This contract was over invoiced by us to the tune of US$43. Million {Forty Three Million United States Dollars).  Myself and my partner reached a compromise to transfer the  fund into a Foreign bank account that will accommodate  this fund. We have all modalities set.  We were disappointed last time by a US Senator, Late Paul Wellstone whom we trusted with a transaction of this nature up to the tune of $45 Million USD in 2001. They sat on our money for no apparent reason and was still holding our money until his family were killed in a plane crash last December.   We still believe  that good people still exist in this world and we are willing to try again with you, bearing in mind that God will all way fight for us.  You can confirm the above transaction from Mr. Clarence Barnes, Uncle to the Senator, who provided the receiving bank account.  His email address is cbarnes@worldemail.com and phone 1-661-310-2112.   He is enjoying our collective money and refused to give us our share but we believe, he shall meet his doom as Senator did.  Because of this we are afraid and we need your total trust and assurance that you must be an honest and straight forward person.  We made a costly mistake with the Senator, by not going into agreement.  Based on our status as senior government officials in top sensitive position of trust, we cannot stand to claim this money ourselves without the assistance of a foreigner.  The process will not require your presence here in UAE.  I guarantee that this transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.  We intend to share the money in the following manner: 30% for you, 60% for us and 10% will be for any expenses incured during the transfer.  Contact me immediately if you are interested for further details.  We look forward to a fruitful business relationship with you and your urgent response.  Best Regards,  Mr. Nasser Bin Nasiri.

Unfortunately they all lost their lives in the event of the accident. Since then, I have made several enquiries to your Embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives but this was unsuccessful. After several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet to locate any member of his family but to no avail, hence I contacted you.  I contacted you to assist in repartrating the money and property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Bank where this huge deposits were lodged.  Particularly, the Bank where the deceased had an account valued at about US$35.5M. (thirty-five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United Stated Dollars) has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated.  Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over three years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you are from the same country so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$35.5M. can be paid to you and then we can share the money between us. 60% to me and 30% to you,while 10% should be for expenses and tax as your government may require.  I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please reply immediately if you are interested to enable us discuss further.

I NEED YOUR MUTUAL ASSISTANCE THE CHAIRMAN ECOWAS CONTRACT AWARDING COMMITTEE ECOWAS HEADQUATERS ACCRA GHANA WEST AFRICA. I am Mr.Kazeem Ahmed,the Chairman of ECOWAS contract awarding committee in ecowas sub-regional head quarter in Accra Ghana, West Africa. In due respect and regard, I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in my department,we discovered a huge sum of money that was over invoiced amounting $35,000,000.00 and un-recorded for in the books of Accounts.We discovered that it has been floating since 1997 through 2001 in international Bank of Africa Accra Ghana. this is found out to be over influence on contract payments and over invoice. Personally the information is kept secret by me and my partner to enable the whole plan and ideas profitable and successful during the time of execution. As it may interest you to know, I got your contact through business inquires from the  chamber of commerce here in my country as I was making contact for an honest foreigner who will assist me in this transaction.

In fact I could have done this alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eyebrow on my side during the time of transfer. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow, who will forward claim as the contractor and also present a foreign account where the money would be tranferred to as a payment for contract executed as it may be after due verification by designated board.  I would not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk-free.

KALADA HART MR. KALADA HART ORIENT BANK (NIG.) LTD. IDUMOTA BRANCH  LAGOS. - NIGERIA. Dear Sir, I am Mr Kalada Hart, Bank Manager of Orient Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have an urgent and very confidential business  proposition for you. On September 6, 1997, a Canadian Oil consultant/contractor with  the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Jerry Sheldon  made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months,  valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding  address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and  finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian  National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Jerry Sheldon died from  an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that  he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next  of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that  Mr. Jerry Sheldon did not declare any kin or relations in all his  official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the  interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each  year. No one has ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian  Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the  ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the  next of kin to Mr. Jerry Sheldon so that the fruits of this old man's  labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government official s. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full  names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary  documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.  We shall employ the service of two Attorney for drafting and notarization  of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/ administration in your favor for the transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then  facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of  70% for me and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be  done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guaranttees  the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested,  please reply immediately via the private email address  below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details  and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall  require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either  a Christian organization or a  devoted Christian individual that will utilize this money the way  I am going to instruct here in.    I want this Christian organization or individual to use this  money in all sincerity to fund  churches, orphanages, widows and also propagating the word of God  and to ensure that the society  upholds the views and beliefs of the holy bible. The holy bible  emphasized so much on the giving  of alms, charity and this has encouraged me in taking this bold  step. I took this decision  because I don't have any child and my late husband's relatives  are all Muslims and I don't want  my husband&#8217;s hard earned money to be misused by people that call  me an unbeliever. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an  unholy manner hence the reasons for  taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with  God the highest and the most  merciful one. I don't need any telephone communications but will  only give you the contact of my  lawyer because he is the one who is going to assist you in making  you the beneficiary of the  consignment in the finance and security firm if you receive this  letter and accept to assist me  to conclude this transaction, if you want to speak with me he  will arrange for that because my  doctor warned me not to talk for too long a time and secondly, I  can't discuss in the presence of my husbands relatives for they always stay with me in the  hospital, my lawyer is the only person  that knows the decision that I am taking. With God, I know that all things are possible and as soon as I  receive your reply through my  lawyer I will now give him instruction to make you the  beneficiary of the consignment and all  necessary steps to take before receiving these funds and I shall  also give you the contact of the finance and security firm I will also issue you a letter of  authority that will prove you as the  original beneficiary of the funds. I want you and the Christian  community where you reside to  always pray for me.  My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted Christian  though married to a Muslim,  whoever that wants to serve God must serve him in truth and in  spirit, please always be prayerful  all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room  in souring for another Christian organization or a devoted Christian for the same purpose.  Until I hear from you my dreams will rest squarely on your  shoulders, may the Almighty God  continue to guide and protect you. Amen.

I AM REQUESTING FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE,DIRECTOR/CEO FROM PRINCE CHARLES ZUMA JOHANNEBURG SOUTH AFRICA E-MAIL: prince_charleszuma@fsmail.net  TEL:27-83-508 5448 E-MAIL: prince_charleszuma@fsmail.net ATTN:DIRECTOR/C .E. O With due respect trust and humility, I write you this proposal, which I believe will be a great interest to you. I found your contact while I was doing a private research on the Internet for a reliable and capable foreign partner that will assist my family and I. That's why I contacted you. I am Prince Charles Zuma the first son of Late Mr.Morris Zuma who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I found your contact while I was doing a private research on the Internet for a reliable and capable foreign partner that will assist my family in a business transaction, hence I decided to write to you. Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to Deposit the sum of US$29 M (Twenty Nine Million United States Dollars). in a private security company, as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was deposited in a box as Precious Metals to avoid any suspicion from the security company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals and establishment of a new Commercial farm in Swaziland. This land problem came up when Zimbabwe President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a New Land Act reform, which wholly affected the rich white Commercial farmers and some few Black Commercial farmers. This resulted to killings and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans in the society. In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act for which my father is a victim. It is against this background that my family and I who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my father's money to a foreign Country since the law of South Africa prohibits refugees to transact any business with the bank. As the eldest son of my father, I am given the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign partner who will provide a foreign account where this money could be transferred into as soon as possible for the investment of my family. I must also let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free. If you accept to assist my family and me. All I want from you is for you to make arrangements and come to Johannesburg,South Africa so that you can open a non-resident account in your name which will aid us in transferring this money into any account you will nominate overseas. I have two options, firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction, or you can go into partnership with me for proper profitable investment of the money in your country.Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses that might be incured in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you 20% of the total money, while 75% will be for my family and me. If you are really capable and willing to assist me, please contact me immediately on the above telephone or by email. Finally, please treat this matter as urgent and Confidential. I intend to leave this country soonest. Thanks for your mutual co-operation. I expect your urgent response. Best Regards, PRINCE CHARLES ZUMA
hello my dear hello my dear, my name is aishatu ahmed.my father was recently murdered in tripoli as a result of family and friends conflicts due to a substantial amount he made while he was in the ministry.generally,most rich men keep such fund at their homes as it is illegal for one to keep such amount in any bank in lybia without a proper explaination as per how such fund was made .so these wicked people thought that this fund was still in our mansion and they tried to eliminate all our house hold in order to get free access to our home to search for it  unknowing to them that my late father had already moved the fund to a finance house in europe through diplomatic means leaving me as the beneficiary as if he forsaw the danger in our family.just one week after his burial,these people broke into our home with gun shots everywhere which resulted to the death of my only little brother.that very night,i and my mother escaped and ran to a country(by road) called burkina faso where we ar!  e for the moment in a hidden hotel.i got your contact from a consultancy firm here in burkina faso,though i did not let them know my main reason of contacting you for confidential sake as i only told them that i needed your contact for pen pals.i need your faithfully and confidential asistance to get this fund from the finance house in europe as we are financially down due to our unprepared journey to this place,ofwhich we left all our belongings and other valuables for our dear lives hoping to get this money out of the finance house.luckily for us,we came here with all the documents relating to this fund.if you have any question to ask,please feel free to do so and get back to me soonest. aishatu
EMAIL ME ON THIS ISSUE FROM THE DESK OF  MR JERRY OZUBA  N N P C.  MUTUAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP-STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.  I am Jerry.Ozuba,the chief accountant of The Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and I head a five man tender board in charge of contract award and payment approvals.I came to know of you in my search for a reliable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.  There were series of contracts executed by a consortion of  multinationals in the oil industry in favour of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) among which were for the following:  1. The expansion of the pipelines network within for a crude down stream products distribution and subsequent evacuation which cost $8bUSD(8 Billion United States Dollars).  2. Contract for the turn around maintenance (TAM) of the various refineries in the country $115 million Uited States Dollars.  3. The construction of storage tanks for petrolwum products (depots) $190 Million United States Dollars.  The original value of these contracts were delebrately over invoiced in the sum $69mUSD (sixty nine Million United States Dollars Only) which has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred, being that the companies that actually executed these contracts had been fully paid when the projests were officially commissioned.  It does not matter whether your comapny did the contract or not, the assumption is that your company won the major contract and sub-contracted it out to other companies.  Consequently, my colleaques and I are willing to transfer the total  amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil service laws) from opening and or operating foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust imposed on you at this junction is  enormous.  In return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 5% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and  external) between the parties in the course of the transaction, and the remaining 75% is for us,the Nigerian  officials.  Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the fund within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the  above stated terms.  Our assurance is that your role is risk free,I accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the fund,the whole approval procedures will be officially and legally processed with the name of any company you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary of the above mentioned amount.  Therefore, when the business is successfully concluded we shall through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the concerned government ministries for 100% security risk free.  Once more, I want you to understand that having put in over 19 years in the civil service of my country, I am very careful to have my image and career deemed.  Please contact me immediately through E-mail whether you are  interested in this deal or not, if you are not, it will enable us scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal but where you are interested send the required documents.  Send by Email for security reasons with this email address jerry_640@fsmail.net  Thanks as I await in anticipation for your fullest co-operation.  Very truly yours,  JERRY.OZUBA.

ASSISTANCE CLAIM OF FUND FROM:MR.FRANK SHABALALA .  44 WITS STREET SANDTON,  JHB,SOUTH AFRICA.  EMAIL ADDR:mr_frank2020@hotmail.com  TEL:+27 83 740 2698  ATTENTION:C.E.O,  I am MR.FRANK SHABALALA, an officer incharge of delivery department in Operations GLOBAL SECURITY COMPANY,SOUTH AFRICA. Here in south Africa,Our firm is a security company of high repute with years of outstanding service to the people of Africa.  I have resolved to contact you through this medium based on business proposal that will be of mutual benefit to both of us. I got your particulars through a consultant company base on my research for a trustworthy and established person that understands investment ethic for entering into a life time profitable joint partnership investment and also co-operation with confidence and trust that you will keep the contents secret and not divulged to any third  party.  To be explicit and straight to the point. Some time early 1997, a reputable client of ours deposited a consignment in our company's vault for safe keeping. And since then our client has failed to come forward  to claim his consignment, which has accumulated a considerable amount of money in demurrage.Consequently, in our bide to contact this client to redeem the demurrage which his consignment had accumulated we discovered that our client was the former president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who died of illness after he was de-throwed in the same year the consignment was entrusted into our care.  Since the death of our client President Mobutou Sese seko, none of his benefactors has come forward to claim the consignment with us, which means that non of his relatives or aids had any knowledge of this consignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided to scanned the  box after some of workers have been dismissed for the day l find out that our client deposited in our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the  box that were registered as treasurer by our client actually contained a considerable amount of money in United States Dollars amounting to about US$35million Dollar. Since this development I have been nursing plans secretly.  I also found out from enquiries and the foreign media that our late client  siphoned a lot of money from his country while he was in office as head of state.It is my conviction that the consignment in our vault was part of the money that our client siphoned and now that he is dead there is no race to this money in our care. I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist me in transferring this money out of South Africa to your country for immediate investment with your assistance.  I have also decided that you will generously be entitled to 30% of the total amount. Upon my receipt  of your reply confirming your willingness to assist me of this transaction, I will immediately arrange and transfer all the rights of ownership of this consignment to your name to facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of the complete funds to your country, all the  documents that covers this box of consignment will be send to you  so that you as far as l concern.  you have nothing to worry about, as I will  be there to assist you in anyway necessary with all proper documentation.  This transaction is 100% risk free. Please maintain absolute confidentiality on this matter. Please reply to the above email address with your telephone and fax so that i can call you.  Thanks.  Yours faithfully.  MR.FRANK SHABALALA.

I seek your consent and permission to present you as the next of kin so that the  proceeds  valued at $20 million dollars can be paid to you  and  then we can share the money. 65% to me  while 30%  to you. Then the balance of 5% will be  reserved for incidental expences.  I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up this transaction.  All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through.  I am very sure with your trust and asistance, we will successfully and legally transfer  this money to you before the finance company take any decision about it.

GOOD DAY >From princess ifeoma  The Palace of King of Ogoni Kingdom,  Ogoni Oil producing community,  Rivers State Nigeria.  PRINCESS Email ADDRESS:princess_ifeoma201@hotmail.com  My lawyer phone number  234-8033072775  Email: him for more information please  Dear Sir, I am Princess IFEOMA , daughter of HRH King  Solomon Abonime, the king of Ogoni Kingdom. I am 25  years old and a graduate of Mass Communication. My  father was the king of Ogoni Kingdom the highest oil  producing area in Nigeria. He was in charge of  reviving royalties from the multi-national oil  companies and government on behalf of the oil  producing communities in Nigeria. After the hanging of  the Ogoni Nine(9) including Ken Saro Wiwa by the late  dictator General Sani Abacha, my father suffered  stroke and died in August27th last year. But before  his death, he called me and told me he has sixthy six Million United States Dollars  (USD66,000,000.00) cash in his possession, specially  deposited in a Security vault company in eroupe. He  advised me not to tell anybody except my mother who is  the last wife of the (8) eight wives that he married.  My mother did not bear any male child for him. Which  implies that all my father?s properties, companies  e.t.c., we have no share in them because my mother has  no male child according to African Tradition. My  father therefore secretly gave me all the relevant  documents of the said money, and told me that I should  use this money with my mother and my younger sisters  because he knows that tradtionally, if he dies we  cannnot get anything, as inheritance. He importantly  advised me that I should seek foreign assistannce and  that I should not invest this money here in Nigeria  because of his other wives and male children who  happen to be my elders. I am soliciting for your  immediate assistance to get a Bungalow for us, where I  will live with my mother and two younger sisters and  further advise me where and how I will invest the  balance money overseas, possibly on products of your  company and other profitable ventures. I believe that  by the special grace of God, you will help us move  this money out of eroupe to your country where we can  invest this money judiciously with you. You are  entitled to a reasonable part of this money based on  our agreement, and God will bless you as you help us.  PLease reply through my e-mail Looking forward to hear  from you as soon as possibleand also my lawyer  email address:(adekunle_smithmike@hotmail.com). Regards. Princess  Ifeoma.

GOOD DAY TO YOU!!! Dear Beloveth, I am Prince Fayad W. Bolkiah, the eldest son of Prince Jefri Bolkiah, former Finance Minister of Brunei, the tiny oil-rich sultanate on the Gulf Island. I will save your time by not amplifying my extended royal family history, which  has already been disseminated by the international media during the controversial dispute that erupted between my father and his step brother, the sultan of Brunei Sheik Muda Hassanal Bolkiah. As you may know from the international media, the sultan had accused my father of financial mismanagement and impropriety of US$14.8 Billion dollars. This was as a result of the Asian financial crisis that made my father company Amedeo Development Company and government owned Brunei Investment Company to be declared bankrupt during his tenure in office. However my father was kept under house arrest, his bank accounts and private properties including a crude oil export refinery were later confiscated by the  sultanate. Furthermore, during this unfortunate period i was advised to evacuate my immediate family outside the sultanate to avoid further prosecution from the sultan and his security operatives, but before I could do that I was placed under house arrest by the Sultan and i have no access to a phone but I have a Palm V hand-held computer from which I am sending you this mail. Before my In-castration, I went ahead to dispatch the sum of Five Hundred  Million United States Dollars US$500 Million in cash under special arrangement  into the custody of different Private security and Trustee companys for safe keeping abroad. The money where splitted and kept in the following countries in this proportion: US$50 Million is in Switzerland, US$100 Million is in London, US$100 Million is in Malaysia, US$80 Million is in United Arab Emirate and the balance US$US170 Million is in Holland. Hence I seek your good assistance to invest these funds into profitable investment in your country to facilitate future survival for my family abroad.I have decided to offer 10% of these funds to you as compensation for your strong cooperation. Please I count on your absolute confidentiality,transparency and trust while looking forward to your prompt reply towards a swift conclusion of this  business transaction. I remain yours sincerely Prince Fayad .W. Bolkiah Brunei Darussalam. please reply to my privite email address-ROYALMAJESTY@K.RO                                                                       
From Reverend Ngoly Dear Friend,  First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction. This   is by the virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential. I am sure  and have confidence of your ability and reliability to prosecute  a transaction of this great magnitude.  We want to transfer (US$150,000,000.00) One hundred and fifty million  United States Dollars from an investment bank in Port Au-Prince,  Haiti to a reliable overseas account.I solicit your assistance to enable us  transfer the said amount into your safe account for onward investment.  You can either provide us with an existing account or to set up a new  bank account immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c  can serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to  me till the end for this important business trusting in you and believing  that you will never let us down either now or in the future.  My name is Rev.Ngo Ngoly. I am the Head of International Operations of a prime commercial bank  here in Bangui, Central African Republic. I have been mandated by a  senior Aide of the exiled Leader of Republic of Haiti, Jean Bertrand  Aristide who have just been abducted and forced to exile in Bangui,  CAR together with his families and aides by the American and French  government, to solicit for a reliable individual or company whom we  can present as a front to effect the transfer of this funds out of Haiti.  The owner has secured this amount with a fictitious name at a bank  in Haiti. This Aide has equally assured me that with the assistance  of their colleagues who are still holding most key post in the financial  power bases of their country, it is not a problem to have the funds  transferred out of the investment bank in Haiti to any other part of  the world except my county, CAR. It is not a good idea to transfer  this amount to my country directly from Haiti due to the fact that my  country is one of the poorest nations in the whole world.  Secondly, the whole world is aware that Mr.Aristide has just arrived in  this country some few days ago to live in exile, it must definitely raise  a big dust when the money arrives here. With my position and  influence in the bank over here, the money can be transferred to  any foreign reliable account that you can provide within 10 days  with assurance that this money will be left untouched until our  physical arrival in your country for sharing. I have secretly discussed  this business with my colleague who also holds a strategic portfolio in  my bank and he has willingly agreed to join the train.  The 20% of this amount will be for you while the remaining balance will  be for all of us here. Please reply immediately if you are interested in this business but if you wish not to participate in the deal for any  reason that will only be known to you and kindly keep all this details strictly  to your self. I will provide you with the full details and our mode of the  operations once I receive your positive response in these regards.  Best regards,  Rev.Ngo Ngoly

ALTERNATIVE E-MAIL:(khalifa_rasheedfatima@yahoo.com )  Please permit me your little endulgence to solicit for your unreserved attention, based on my urgly condition of life though one with almighty Allah is with majority.  I am Mrs Fatima R. Khalifa, a widow to Late Sheik Mohammed Rasheed Khalifa.  I am 64 years old of a born muslim faith. Presently i am suffering from long time cancer of the breast, from all indications, my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious that I won't live more than six months according to my doctor,because the cancer stage has gotten to a very bad stage.  My late husband was killed during the invasion of collition forces from American and Britain in Iraq,unfortunately he died leaving behind a huge sim of money in the vault of a private security company oversea to be precise in Holland, but due to  my present bad condition of health as I am suffering from Cancer of the breast its quite impossible for me to travel that distance to receive this money.  To this effect I have writen a letter throgh my family lawyer requseting for the transfer of this box to Dubai United Arab Emirates pending when I can succeed in getting a trust and  reliable person to utilize this money. Although, today, I have a signal from Dubai notifying me of the arrival of the consignment in their security costody.  I want you to understand that a neither have any son nor have any person to entrust this money to which I know that it is better make use of a total foreigner to achieve my aim.  Atleast had it been that during the period of our marriage we could produce any child, my late husband was very wealthy and after his death, his offspring will inherited all his business and  wealth.I got your contact through a desperate and personal search on the web, for someoneI could really trust and I have prayed over it.  Therefore my desire now is to contribute this wealth to the propagation of islam and in assisting the less-privileged Muslim faithful in Africa,Asia,Europe and in all Arab-Nation's .  I have discussed this with my Family Lawyer hence I am willing to donate the sum of US$16,250,00000. (sixteen Million two hundred and fifty thousand US Dollars)for the development of the holy  work of islam, as well as distribution's to aid muslim's faithfuls.  Please I want you to note that, this fund is lying in a Security Company in United Arab Emirate (UAE).  For that, my lawyer will file application's that will back you up for the transfer of the money in your name as the beneficiary only if you promise to use this funds judiciary for  the said purpose.  Therefore,I have decided to set-aside 40% for the promotion of holy islam and the work of Allah.  while 30% will be retuned back to me through my lawyer so that I can offset my bills in the hospital because of the cancer treatment.  If you have to die says the Allah, keep fit and I will give you the crown of life.  May the Grace of Allah be our guide and be my refuge when i leave this  world.  Moreso,I further decided to offer you 20% While the remaining 10%  is for the expenses incured during the facillitation of the fund.

Consider this Proposal Dear Sir,                       FUNDS TRANSFER PROPOSAL. I am Dr. Richard Mboweni, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (US$18,500,000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount (US$18.5m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30% of the US$18.5 million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hind rance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not  disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my secured email address richard_mboweni@rediffmail.com whether or not you are interested in this deal.  If you are not, it will enable me contact other another Foreign partner with recommendation to carry out this deal. I want to assure you that myself and my partners are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and Please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter; because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business. I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. I am available to entertain any questions concerning the clarity of this transaction. Yours faithfully, Dr. Richard Mboweni                                                                       
Dearest friend Dearest friend  From: Mrs. Juliana Faith Peters  Bless the children of God.  I am the above named person but now undergoing medical  treatment now. I am married to Dr.Alan George Peters  who worked with south africa embassy in nigeria for  nine years before he died in the year 2001.  We were married for eleven years without a child. He  died after a brief illness that lasted for only four  days. Before his death we were both born again  Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry  or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the  Bible is against.When my late husband was alive he  deposited the sum of$27.6Million (twenty-seven Million  six hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with one  finance/security company in Europe.  Presently, this money is still with the Security  Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not  last for the next three months due to cancer problem.  Though what disturbs me most is my stroke.   Having known my condition I decided to donate this  fund to church or better still a christian individual  that will utilize this money the way I am going to  instruct here in. I want a church or individual that  will use this to fund churches, orphanages and widows  propagating the word of God and to ensure that the  house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to  understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.  I took this decision because I don?t have any child  that will inherit this money and my husband relatives  are not Christians and I don?t want my husband?s hard  earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don?t  want a situation where this money will be used in an  ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold  decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where  I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom  of the Lord.  Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case  and I shall hold my peace. I don?t need any telephone  communication in this regard because of my health,and  because of the presence of my husband?s relatives  around me always. I don?t want them to know about this  development. With God all things are possible. As soon  as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact  of the Finance/Security Company Europe. I will also  issue you a letter of authority that will empower you  as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you  and the church to always pray for me because the lord  is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of  a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the  Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always  be prayerful all through your  life.  Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing  for a church or christian individual for this same  purpose. Please assure me that you will act  accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from  you.  please reply me through this email;  Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.  Yours in Christ,  Mrs Juliana faith peters.  __________________________________________________  Broadband from an unbeatable £15.99!  http://www.tiscali.co.uk/products/broadband/home.html?code=SM-NL-11AM

PLEASE YOUR ASSISTANCE IN URGENTLT NEEDED Dear Sir, It is with hope that I write to seek your help in the context below. I am Hajia Mariam Abacha, wife of Nigeria�s former head of state; Late General Sani Abacha, whose sudden death occurred on the 8th of June 1998. Since my husband died, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration. The security agents in the country have subjected me to physical and psychological torture. My son (Mohammed Abacha) is still under detention arraigned before the federal high court of Nigeria for an offence he did not commit. As a widow that is so traumatized, I am hopeless with my present faith.  You must have heard over the media reports on the recovery of various sums of money deposited by my late husband with various security firms. Some companies willingly gave up their secret and disclosed our money confidently lodged there, or many, outright blackmail.  Infact the total sum discovered by the government so far is in the tune of $700 Million USD and they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I came in contact with your name and address in a website and would want to have good confidence in you as I view you to be a responsible personality.  I have no doubt about your capacity and goodwill to assist me in receiving into your custody( for safety) the sum of $50 Million USD willed and deposited safely in my favour by my late husband. This money is currently kept in Safe Deposit Box (SDB) at a security firm within Europe. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband�s property is under the authority of the family�s Lawyer (Attorney)Barrister MIKE AHAMBA(SAN). The investigative teams set up by government have submitted their report after freezing almost all our account. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the $50m USD be urgently moved to an overseas account of any trust worthy but ANNONYMOUS foreign family friend without delay, for security reasons.  All our traveling papers have been seized by the government thereby preventing us from traveling and all the local and international outfit of our business empire seized. This sum of money is our only hope to stay alive. I have therefore agreed to compensate your goodself with 10% of the total deposit when you finally the deposit box from the security firm and lodged in your account.  They have equally guaranteed 100% risk-free and smooth transfer. If you are interested in assisting me,you can write me through my e-mail, please reply direct to this email address; dr_mrsabacha@sify.com  for obvious security reasons, it is imperative that you keep all our communication very secret. Donot mention my family"s name or disclose the transaction to anybody. If you are not interested in assisting me, still get in touch so that I can make alternative arrangement as time is of the essence.Please do not expose me. Best Regards, Hajia mariam Abacha EMAIL: dr_mrsabacha@sify.com

TEL: 00229 28 30 63  Please reply to;  alfred_douglas1@yahoo.fr  My dear,  Good day and God bless you. It is with deep sence of commitment, faith and  trust that I make this confidential risk free business proposal to you for  your assistance/partnership. I am deeply sorry if I have in any manner disturbe  your privacy.  I am Mr. Alfred Douglas the head of the Audit Department of Continental  Bank in Cotounu Benin Republic.

During the period of my investigation I discovered  that the deceased left no will and nobody behind to come for the claim as  his beneficiary. Since then several inquiries to locate any of MR. PIERE  JOHNSON extended relatives have proved unsuccessful, hence I decided to  contact you since the banking law here stipulates that if such money remain  unclaimed for a period of time, it will be forfieted to the gorvernment  treasury as an unclaimed fund which will be expended on acquiring dangeriouse  weaponse for the support of their selfish political interest and promoting  wars and ethnic crises in Africa. I  have decided to contact you to assist  me to pull out this fund from this bank as the business partner of MR. PIERE  JOHNSON for the claim of the fund. I want to also bring to your notice that  as the Head of the Audit department of this bank if this fund is not pulled  out before our auditing the fund fund will be discovered by my colleagues  and that will definately lead to the government confiscating the money into  the federation account.  You might ask what will be the proceedure to achieve this. As soon as I  get your positive response to assist me, I will then send to you the proceedure  and the next step to follow. So if this meets your interest then get back  to me to enable me send to you the procedure of claiming this fund. I have  in my possetion all the necessary information of the deceased (MR. PIERE  JOHNSON) that will help us successfully accomplish this transaction. You  shall be offered 30% for your assistance, while 5% shall be set aside for  any expences that we might incure during the transaction.

During the current war against the farmers in Zimbabwe from the supports of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white-owned farms to his party members and his followers, he ordered all the  white-owned farmers to surrender all their farms to his party members and his followers.  My father was one of the best farmers in our country and because he  did not support his idea,supporters invaded my father's farm and burnt  everything in the farm, killing my father and mad away with a lot of items in my father's farm.  After the death of my father, me and my mother and my younger sister decided to move out from Zimbabwe because our lives are still in danger  with the money my father kept in his hidden safe in my mother's house. The amount contained in the safe is US$12.8m (Twelve million, eight hundred thousand US dollars)and we decided to move to the United Arab Emirate(U.A.E) where we deposited the money in a Security Company as valuables.So, I decided to contact overseas Firm that will assist me to move this money out of United Arab Emirate.

S. Dollars which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount (Twenty - Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you, hence provide me with your private/direct fax number for the form to be send across to you.

I NEED YOUR URGENT ASSISTANCE FROM: MR. WILLIAMS SAVIMBI  TELL: 27-833-515247  E-MAIL: william_savimbi2001@yahoo.com  JOHANNESBURG SOUTH AFRICA  Private and Confidential  Dear Sir,  You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not  know me personally. I am Mr. Williams savimbi (Jnr) the first son of  MR.NKONNOH SAVIMBI, who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe.  I got your contact through my research in the South African Chambers of  Commerce & Industries for a responsible and a God fearing person who I  can trust by using his personality and his bank account for this  transaction. When I got your contact, I prayed over it then I decided  to write to you.  Before the death of my father, he deposited the sum of USD$10 Million  (TENMILLION UNITDED STATES DOLLARS) in one of the private security  companies, in Johannesburg South Africa as if he fore saw the looming danger in  Zimbabwe.  This money is protected in a big metal box and was declared to the  security company at the point of deposit as precious valuables e.g.:  Gold, diamond and germ stone to avoid the security company knowing that the  content of the consignment deposited with them contains cash. This amount was  meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and  establishment of a new farm in Swaziland.  This land problem came when Zimbabwe President MR.ROBERT MUGABE  introduced a New Land Act reform, which wholly affected the rich white  and some few black farmers. This resulted to killing and mob action by Zimbabwean  warveterans. In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land  reform act for which my father was one of the victims.  It is for this reason that my family and i who are staying in South  Africa now as refugees have decided to transfer my father's money to a  foreign country since the law of South Africa prohibits a person with a refugee  status to operate a bank account or do any banking transaction in South  Africa.  As the only son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of  seeking for a genuine foreign account where this money could be  transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on my family. I  must also let you know that this transaction is 100%risk free.  If you are really capable and willing to assist me, I and my family has  promised to give you 30% of the total money, 10% is for the expenses  that may occur during the time of the transaction and the rest of the  70%is for me and my family for the investment in your country.  Please contact me immediately with the above recommended private  e-mail:william_savimbi2001@yahoo.com phone 27-833-515247 indicating  your interest. Please be aware that confidentiality and urgency is very  vital to this transaction.  Thanks for your mutual co-operation as I expect your soonest response.  Best regards  Mr. Williams Savimbi

In the light of the fact, I needed your assistance to open your door to  this opportunity by providing your account or any account of your choice where  the fund will be remitted. I want to transfer this money into a safe foreigner’s  account abroad but I don’t know any one who could actually assist, I am only  contacting you as a foreigner because this money can only be approved to a  foreign account because the money is in US Dollars and the owner of the account  ENGR. SMITH U. WILLIAMS and a foreigner too.  I know that this mail will come as surprise to you as we don’t know  ourselves, but be sure that is for real.

Business Proposal Attn: President/Ceo.  STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL  RE: TRANSFER OF US$21.5 MILLION (TWENTY ONE MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS ONLY).  I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek for foreign assistance/partnership in a business transaction, which is of mutual benefit.  I am a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract Award and Monitoring Committee in the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in NNPC by my Committee. This contract was over invoiced to the tune of US$21.5M. U.S. dollars. This was done deliberately. The over-invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the project. We now want to transfer this money which is in a suspense Account with NNPC into any Overseas Account which we expect you to provide for us.  SHARE: -  For providing the account where we shall remit the money into, you will be entitled to 30% of the money, 60% will be for me and my partners while 10% has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any expenses that maybe incurred by us during the course of this transfer, both locally and international expenses.  I would require the following: -  1. Your company's names, address telephones and fax numbers.  2. The bank where the money will be remitted to.  The above information would be used to make formal applications as a matter of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer to your account. It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of this nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it out to other companies. More often than not, big trading companies or firms of unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontracts to more specialized firms for execution of such contracts.  We have strong reliable connections and contacts at the Central Bank of Nigeria, as well as the Federal Ministry of Finance and we have no doubt that all the money will be released and transferred if we get the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal. Therefore, when the business is successfully concluded we shall through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the concerned Government Ministries for 100% security.  We are ordinary civil servants and we will not want to miss this once in a lifetime opportunity to get rich. We want this money to be transferred to the overseas Accounts for us, before the present Democratic Government starts auditing all Federal Government owned Parstatals.  Please contact me immediately through my private mailbox (tobi4120a@k.ro). If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal. But where you are interested, send the required documents aforementioned herein through my above mailbox, as time is of the essence in this business.  I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.  Yours faithfully,  Mr.James Tobi

GOOD DAY FRIEND CHALLENGE SECURITIES  AND FINANCE LTD  LAGOS, NIGERIA  ATTENTION:SIR  I am MR.ISA MUHAMEED, the Director of Operations  CHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD,LAGOS NIGERIA. Here in  NIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high repute  with years of outstanding service to the people of  Africa.I have resolved to contact you through this  medium based on business proposal that will be of  mutual benefit to both of us.  I got your particulars through a consultant company  base on my research for atrustworthy and established  person that understands investment ethic for entering  into a life time profitable joint partnership  investment and also co-operation with confidence and  trust that you willkeep the contents secret and  divulged to any third party.  To be explicit and straight to the point. Some time  early 1997, a reputable client of ours deposited  aconsignment in our company\'s vault for safe  keeping.And since then our client has failed to come  forward to claim his consignment, which has  accumulated aconsiderable amount of money in  demurrage.Consequently, in our bide to contact this  client to redeem the demurrage which his consignment  had accumulated we discovered that our client was the  former president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who  died of illness after he was de-throwed in the same  year the consignment was entrusted into our care.Since  the death of our client President Mobutou Seseseko,  none of his benefactors has come forward to claim the  consignment with us, which means that non of his  relatives or aids had any knowledge of this  consignment.  Hence out of curiosity I decided to secretly open the  two boxes that our client deposited in our vault. And  to my surprise I discovered that the two boxes that  were registered as treasurer by our client actually  contained a considerable amount of money in United  States Dollars amounting to about US$30 million  Dollar.

It does matter whether it is a corporate or personal account but as long as the account is active to receive the amount of this magnitude, it is very ok to us. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not permit us to operate offshore/foreign account of any kind hence you are very important towards the successful completion of this whole transaction that we shall both benefits from. This US$38.5M arose from the balance of the total contract value for the renovation and upgrading of (Pretoria, Johannesburg and Soweto national stadium for 2006 bid that we lost to Germany before it was awarded to us again in 2010 with the help of our former president Mr Nelson Mandela) our national stadium by foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately, though the actual contract cost have been fully paid to the original contractor.

The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me because our share of the funds with your assistance we shall invest in property management/real estate business in your country. And that is why we offered you 25% of the total amount not just to receive the funds for us alone because once the fund is transferred to your account without your help we shall be lost since most of my life I have been a civil servant.  Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above Tel and Fax number or my e-mail address: (DSolow@latinmail.com) if you are willing to help in this matter and I also want to guarantee you that my partner and myself are in a better position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.

From. Engr. Sule Alkali  Dear Sir/Madam, I am Engr. Sule Alkali Director, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources (MPNR) Lagos, and have been delegated by my colleagues to seek the assistance of a reliable foreign company or individual into whose bank account we can transfer the sum of $36,560,000.00 USD (Thirty Six Million Five Hundred and Sixty Thousand U.S. Dollars Only). This sum arose from a deliberate over-invoicing of contract bills of some contracts, which were awarded by us (MPNR) during the administration of the former military dictator late, General Sanni Abacha who died on 7th June 1998. Since then the money has been lying in our suspense current account of MPNR with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)(our Apex Bank). However, the current favorable political/Economical climate in the country now presents an opportunity for this money to be Transferred out of our country without any hitches - as we hope and believe it would be of mutual benefit to both of us. Already, we have put in motion the complete machinery and modalities to enhance successful commencement and completion of this transaction and further actions will commence the moment we hear from you. We have agreed that after the transfer of the money into your account, you shall be entitled to 20% of the total sum.

CONFIDENTIAL. FROM MR OMARU AMINU, AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT. FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT. INTERNATIONAL BANK OF AFRICA OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO. Sir, I am MR OMARU AMINU,the director,in charge of Auditing and Accounting  section of International Bank of Africa Ouagadougou Burkina faso,in West  Africa in due respect and regards.I have decided to contact you on a  business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end  of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in the bank, my department came across  a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person, a foreigner who  died on november 2000  in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his  account with the bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either  from his family or relation before our discovery to this development. Although personally,i kept this information secret within myself and  partners to enable the whole plans and idea be profitable and successful  during the time of execution.The said amount was USD$14m (fourteen million  united states dollars). As it may intrest you to know, I got your contact  through international business enquiry on internet. I believe you will be viable and capable to champion a business of such  magnitude without any problem. Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put  claim over this fund as the bona fide next of kin to the deceased, get the  required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put  in place and directives/needed information will be relayed to you as soon as  you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit  your self to this great business opportunity. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this  country as a civil servant,we are not allowed to operate a foreign account  and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of  transfer because I work in this bank.This is the actual reason why it will  require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin  with affidavit of trust of Oath to the bank and also present a foreign  account where he will need the money to be re-transfered into on his request  as it may be, after due verification and clarification by designated bank  account. I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On  smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the  total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of  expenses that may arise during the time of transfer such as telephone bills  etc, while 60% will be for me and my partners. Please,you have been advised  to keep top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from  service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole  situation here in the bank until you confirm the money in your account.And  ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund  according to percentages previously indicated and further investment,either  in your country or any other country you may advice us to invest in.All  other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you.I  suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this  deal. Yours faithfully, MR OMARU AMINU. _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger! Download today it's FREE!  http://messenger.msn.com/
urgent reply FROM THE DESK OF DON HOSE NANDO  AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING MANEGER ,  BANCO POPULARE DE ESPANA.  Dear Friend,  I am the manager of billing and exchange at the  foreign remittance department of BANCO POPULARE DE ESPANA here in Madrid Spain. In my department. we discovered an abandoned sum of ??m euros (FOURTY Million  euros) in an account that belongs to one of our  foreign customer (MR. Rudi Fassnacht from Cologne, Germany) who died along with his entire family in Jully 2000 in a  plane crash.For more informations about the crash you  can visit this site:  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm  Since we got information about his death, we have been  expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his  money because we cannot release it unless some body  applies for it as next of kin or relation to the  deceased as indicated in our banking guidlings and  laws but unfortunately we  learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation  died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving  nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this  discovery that I now decided to make this business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the  next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and  subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it  and we don't want this money to go into the Spanish  treasury government account as unclaimed funds.  The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if  such money remained unclaimed after five years, the  money will be transfered into the government treasury  account as unclaimed funds. The request of foreigner  as next of kin  in this business is occassioned by the fact that the  customer was a foreigner and a Spanish cannot stand as  next of kin to a foreigner.  I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a  respect to the provision of a foriegn account ,10%  will be set aside for expenses incurred during the  business and 60% will be invested in any lucrative  business of your choice and as soon as this is done, i  will resign from my work and join you immediatelly.  Remmember that the trust leed upon you is based on  mutual business understanding and a life time  opportunity which i believe you will not allow it go.  To enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you  as arranged,you must apply first to the bank as  relation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of  application  that i will send to you,so i will like you to send to  me your private telephone and fax number for easy and  effective communication and location where the money  will be remitted.  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax  or email the text of the application . I will not fail  to bring to your notice this transaction is hitch-free  and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as  All required arrangements have been made for the  transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as  you receive this letter.  Trusting to hear from you immediately.send all  correspondence by email don_hosenando@yahoo.com for  security reasons  Yours Faithfully,  DON HOSE NANDO

URGENT ASSISTANCE >From Mr. Thomas Reardon, Dear Friend, Greetings to you and your family in the name of God.I am personally contacting you in my search  for a reliable and God fearing person and having gotten your contact through prayers and  painstaking efforts I have decided to seek your help in carrying out my last wish .My name is Thomas Reardon,  55 yrs old and  an American national who lived in Iraq. Until recently I had investments in oil and construction in Baghdad. Since the war started in this country my life has been thrown into severe mystery. I lost my wife and two children to bombs dropped in the city. Today, I�m in a hospital in China with very fatal injuries and I have lost my ability to talk. My doctors have indicated that my chances of survival are very slim. I have therefore decided that part of my fortunes should be distributed to charity works to help victims of the war in sudan, iraq and other war zones and the rest part held in trust by you and use in  future for charity purpose. Before this happened my business and concern for making money was all I lived for.  I never really cared about other values in life. But since the loss of my family, I have found a  new desire to assist helpless families and victims of humanitarian crisis. Shortly after the first gulf war I deposited the sum of  USD$8.5 million dollars  with a financial company in Europe,given the complete ruin and disorder in the country I have no knowledge of any relative who would be available to help me carry out this last wish.  Please I want you to help me collect the deposit  from the company in Europe and distribute it accordingly. I want you to use your discretion and judgement to re-emburse yourself at the end of the day for  all expenses you will incure during the collection and distribution of funds. If you are willing to help, please reply as soon as you can so we can look at your reward and the things you need to do to collect the money. Lastly, A list of this orgainization you intend to distribute this funds to will be highly appreciated. Upon your reply I shall send you the certifiate of deposit and ownership certificate that was issued at the time I deposited the Funds with them. I will also be sending to you my international passport upon your reply. May the good God bless you and your family.  Endeavour to reply through my secured email address; (thomasreardon@myway.com) Thanks/ Regards.

BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP.                     Federal Ministry of Works & Housing                     Radio House, Herbert Macaulay Way(south)                              P.M.B 111, Garki, Abuja                     (Opposite the International Conference Centre)                                                      Dear Sir/Madam, This is to invite you to freely participate in a business venture on  behalf of my partners and I.We especially need you to act as the chief beneficiary of a contract  sum worth $14M in the Ministry of Works & Housing, Nigeria. For your benefit of doubt, we [ my partners & I] are  management  officials in the board team of the above named government parastatal. In  addition, we are members of the internal audit reveiw panel set up to  reconcile all bonifide contract debts being owed to foreigners by the government of Nigeria. In the course of our auditing, we came across the siad sum of $14m  floating in the ministry escrow account as an accrued debt payable to a yet  un-identified contractor since 2001.On thorough examination,it was  discovered that the $14M was a debt brilliantly created by the former  Director General in favour of a company that she was about to incorporate  locally here with the help of a foreign partner. We made consultations with the former DG and eventually struck an  agreement with her.The masterplan she created remains the same.The plan is  to make you the chief beneficiary to the $14M by way of advancing  you/your company as the real contractor to whom the sum is owed by the  Ministry for a project executed between 2000/2001.As a matter of  fact,all  the modalities needed to acheive this has already been perfected. The  overall plan is 100% foolproof and will be carried out legally in every  aspect of the transaction. Specifically,your duty will be to act in  correspondence (viaE-mails,Faxes & Telephone)- with the local Ministry of  Finance as well as the Apex Bank authorities; until your total claims are  verified,approved and the money paid into your advised bank account. Whereas we would like to maintain our full confidentiality for now, we   shall however provide you with more details as to the masterplan and  the entire time frames involved. We will do so when you indicate your  interest to become a partner with us. Looking forward to a cordial business partnership with you. Sincerely, Engr.Idris Lanre. ______________________________________________________ Please reply to my private e-mail :engridrislanre_2005@fastermail.com ______________________________________________________ Engr.

I am pleased to get across to you for a profitable business proposal,  though I don't know you and we had never meant in person but I got your  contact from the Personal Assistance to the former Minister for Sports.  More so she told me that this is your first time in partaking in such  business but you are in a better position to handle the  transaction/business of this magnitude without you running away with our  own share of fund once your account is credited within 4 -5 working days  because before I commence we have to build mutual relationship in respect  of this business that is strictly confidential and all the legal  /essential documents to back up this transaction are in place. And the key  for us building up this mutual relationship is TRUST between both parties  involved that is you and I.  I am in charge of the Auditing for contract  payment with SAFA (South African Football Association) and I truly  apologize for using this means to reach you because I have no other  choice.Within the South African Football Association and the cooperation  of my colleague, I have in my possession as overdue payment bills totaling  Eighteen Million Three Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (US$18,3M). With  your assistance and fullest co-operation, I on behalf of my colleague beg  you to help us receive these funds by wire transfer that is presently  lying in a suspended account with ABSA Bank in Pretoria branch. It does  matter whether it is a cooperate or personal account but as long as the  account is active to receive the amount of this magnitude, it is very ok  to us. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South  Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not permit us to operate  offshore/foreign account of any kind hence you are very important to wards  the successful completion of this whole transaction that we shall both  benefits from. This US$18.3M arose from the balance of the total contract  value for the renovation and upgrading of (Pretoria, Johannesburg and  Soweto national stadium for 2006 bid that we lost to Germany before it was  awarded to us again in 2010 with the help of our former president MR  Nelson Mandela) our national stadium by foreign contracting firm, which we  the officials over-invoiced deliberately.

GOOD DAY FRIEND CHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD.  LAGOS, NIGERIA  GOOD DAY FRIEND  ATTENTION:SIR/MADAM  I am MR.VICTOR KOVIS, the Director of Operations  CHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD,LAGOS NIGERIA. Here in  NIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high repute  with years of outstanding service to the people of  Africa.  I have resolved to contact you through this medium  based on business proposal that will be of mutual  benefit to both of us. I got your particulars through  a consultant company base on my research for a  trustworthy and established person that understands  investment ethic for entering into a life time  profitable joint partnership investment and also  co-operation with confidence and trust that you will  keep the contents secret and divulged to any third  party.  To be explicit and straight to the point. Some time  early 1997, a reputable client of o! urs deposited a  consignment in our company's vault for safe keeping.  And since then our client has failed to come forward  to claim his consignment, which has accumulated a  considerable amount of money in demurrage.  Consequently, in our bide to contact this client to  redeem the demurrage which his consignment had  accumulated we discovered that our client was the  former president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who  died of illness after he was de-throwed in the same  year the consignment was entrusted into our care.  Since the death of our client President Mobutou  Seseseko, none of his benefactors has come forward to  claim the consignment with us, which means that non of  his relatives or aids had any knowledge of this  consignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided to  secretly open the two boxes that our client deposited  in our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the  two boxes that were registered as treasure! r by our  client actually contained a considerable amount of  money in United States Dollars amounting to about  US$30 million Dollar. Since this development I have  been nursing plans secretly. I also found out from  enquiries and the foreign media that our late client  siphoned a lot of money from his country while he was  in office as head of state.  It is my conviction that the consignment in our vault  was part of the money that our client siphoned and now  that he is dead there is no race to this money in our  care.  I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist me  in transferring this money out of nigeria to your  country for immediate investment with your assistance.  I have also decided that you will generously be  entitled to 30% of the total amount. Upon my receipt  of your reply confirming your willingness to assist me  of this transaction, I will immediately arrange and  transfer all the rights of ownership of thisconsignment to  your name to facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of the  complete funds to your  country.  you have nothing to worry about, as I will be there  to assist you in anyway necessary with all proper  documentation.  This transaction is 100% risk free.  Please maintain absolute confidentiality on this  matter.  Please reply to the above email address with your  telephone and fax so that i can call you.  Thanks.  Yours faithfully.  MR.VICTOR KOVIS  -------------------------------------------------  sent by Excite Inbox - http://inbox.excite.co.uk  powered by Excite UK - http://www.excite.co.uk 
RE;  VERY  IMPORTANT Dear Sir/Madam,  This mail will definitely be coming to you as a surprise, but I must  crave your indulgence to introduce myself to you.  I am Mr. John mensah Sulikuh, a supervisory manager at the United Trust Bank  Ltd,London. However I got your contact through the International web  directory.Recently we discovered a Dormant Account with a huge Amount of  Money  ValuedUSD17, 600,000.00 (Seventeen Million, six hundred Dollars Only) that  belongs to One of our late Customer MR. KRAANVOGEL DIONIJS. who died In a  plane crash. During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my  Department came Across a very huge sum of money belonging to MR.  KRAANVOGEL DIONIJS from Beverwijk, Netherlands, who died along with his  wife, MRS. KATRIEN DIONIJS and Daughter, MS. SOFIE DIONIJS so the fund has  Been dormant in his account with this Bank without Any claim of the fund in  our custody either from his Family or relation before Our discovery to this  development.  The Banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for 15  years, it will be forfeited to the Bank Treasury as an unclaimed bill. It is  only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and it is upon this  discovery that I decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out  this dormant fund.In order to avert this negative development. On behalf of  my trusted colleagues we now seek your permission to have you stand in as  next of kin to Our late Customer so that the fund will be released and  paid into your account as the beneficiary’s next of kin now that the bank is  still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased, MR. KRAANVOGEL  DIONIJS.  We could have done this deal alone but because of our position in this  country as civil servants, we are not allowed to operate a foreign account  and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the time of  transfer since we still work in this bank, this is the actual reason why  we required a second party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as  the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account or to set  up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this fund, even an empty a/c can  also serve for this purpose.  However, on smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to  25% as gratification for your assistance to us, while 5% will be set aside  to take care of expenses on both sides that may arise during the time of  transfer and also for telephone bills, and the remaining 70% will be for me  and my colleague.  What I want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin. I have  in my possession, all the necessary Documents to successfully accomplish  the operation. Bear in mind that this proposal is 100% risk free. Further  Information will be given to you as soon as I receive your positive  response. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your  wish. For confidentiality please contact me on my personal email  account:sulikuh_john@rediffmail.com and sulikuh_john@ourwest.com <mailto:sulikuh_john@ourwest.com>  Best Regards,  Mr. John Mensah Sulikuh  United Trust Bank Ltd 
GREETINGS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. Alternate email address: josemartinezguzman1940@yahoo.es  Dear friend, Greetings to you and your family! This mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignore it as unserious could come into your mind; but please consider it a divine wish and accept it with a deep sense of humility.  My name is Jose Martinez Guzman. I am a 65 years old man, I am Cuban currently residing in Madrid (Spain). I was formerly living in Cuba and served under Castro`s government but had to run into self exile after the ruling Government of Fidel Castro closed in on my family on accusations of anti-government statements, I was once married with two children but my family could not escape before the deadly hands of Castro`s goons fell on them.  l did made a lot of money serving Castro and on getting to Spain, I have been a merchant here in Madrid dealing in Ornamentals, Oriental Carpets and Artifacts and life was very smooth for me until about three(3) years ago when I was first diagnosed of Cancer of the Larynx. Before this happened my business and concern for making money was all I lived for, I never really cared about other values in life. But since the loss of my family and hometown, I have found a new desire to assist helpless families. I have been helping orphans in orphanage/motherless homes. I have once donated some money to orphans in war ravaged Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan and some East European Countries.  Before I became ill, I kept $US 5.5 Million in a long-term deposit vault of a bank and I didn`t state any next of kin when the money was deposited and if I died without stating any the money will automatically go into the coffers of the bank and I don`t want this to happen. I have left the hospital and presently receiving treatment in an acupuncture clinic, I have been undergoing treatment for Oesophageal Cancer at the hospital. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live.  It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations, because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them. Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me collect the deposit and distribute it amongst charity organizations and the incident that happened in Asia too.  Use your judgement to distribute the money and feel free to reimburse yourself when you have the money for any cost you incur during the process of collecting and distributing the money to charity organizations. I am going to send you vital documents to back my claims and I am willing to offer you a reward If you are willing to help, please reply as soon as you can on my alternate email address: josemartinezguzman1940@yahoo.es  Looking forward to hearing from you soonest. Regards, Jose Martinez Guzman

I am Barrister prince  godwin , a solicitor at law. I am  the personal attorney to Mr.Morie Curtis , a national of  your country,possibly could be your brother, who used  to work with shell Development Company in Nigeria.  Here in after shall be referred to as my client. On  the 21st of April 1999, my client, his wife and their  two Children were involved in a plane crash in a  remote village called Kuru near Jos in Plateau State.  All occupants of the plane unfortunately lost their  lives.  Since then I have made several enquiries to your  embassy here in lagos to locate any of my clients  extended relatives this has also proved unsuccessful.  After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided  to track his last name over the Internet, to locate  any member of his family hence I contacted you. I  have contacted you to assist in repatriating the  money and property left behind by my client before  they get confiscated, frozen or declared unserviceable  by the bank where these huge deposits were lodged.  Particularly, the Eco Bank International where the  deceased had an account valued at about Eighteen million  United States Dollars (US$18,000,000.00). The  management has issued me a notice to provide the next  of kin or have the account frozen within the next ten  official working days. Since I have been unsuccessful  in locating the relatives for over 2 years now I seek  your consent to present you as the next of kin of the  deceased since you have the same last name so that the  proceeds of this account valued at $18,000,000:00 can  be paid to you and then you and me can share the  money. 60% to me and 40% to you I have all the  necessary legal documents that can be used to back up  any claim we may make.  And this I must do to make sure that this fund is not  wasted or end up in the wrong hands. All I require is  your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal  through. I guarantee that this will be executed under  a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from  any breach of the law.

From: Mrs.Ruthanne Ruby Martinez, Mutual Trust From: Mrs.Ruthanne Ruby Martinez, Mutual Trust Blessings to you. I am the above named person but now undergoing medical treatment now. I am married to Dr.Waltner De Matinez who worked with angolan embassy in mexico for over nine years before he died in the year 2002. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$27.6Million (twenty-seven million six hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with one finance/security company in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church or individual to that will use this to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of the lord is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don`t have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don`t want my husbands hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know  where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I dont need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health,and because of the presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the  Finance/Security Company Europe. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you. please reply me through my private email; Remain blessed in the name of the Lord. Mrs Ruthanne Ruby Martinez. ___________________________________________________________________________ Mail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site - http://yoursite.com

This amount Eighteen Million, Three Hundred Thousand represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you, hence provide me with your private/direct fax number for the form to be send across to you.

God Bless!! Dear friend, Greetings to you in the name of our heavenly God. This mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignore it as unserious could come into your mind; but please, consider it a divine wish and accept it with a deep sense of humility. My name is JAMES HOWARD. I`m a 55 years old man. I am British living in Dubai (United Arab Emirate). I was a merchant and owned two businesses in Dubai. I was also married with two children. My wife and two children died in a car accident six years ago. Before this happened my business and concern for making money was all I lived for. I never really cared about other values in life. But since the loss of my family, I have found a new desire to assist helpless families. I have been helping orphans in orphanage/ motherless homes. I have donated some money to orphans in Sudan, South Africa, Cameroon, Brazil, Spain, Austria, Germany and some Asian countries. ! Before I became ill, I kept $15 Million in a long-term deposit account in a finance company . Presently, I?m in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for oesophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live. It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations. Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them. Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me collect the deposit and the interest accrued from the company and distributes it amongst charity organizations. Use your judgement to distribute the money and feel free to reimburse yourself when you have the money for any cost you incur during the process of collecting and distributing the money to charity organizations. . I?m willing to offer you a ! reward If you are willing to help; please reply as soon as you can. May the good Lord bless you and your family. Regards, James Howard

RESPONSE ASAP!. MR. SIMON WONG  DAH SING BANK LTD.  19 DES VOEUX RD.   CENTRAL HONG KONG,  HONK KONG.  Dear Friend,  I am Mr.Simon Wong, credit officer of Dah Sing Bank  Ltd, Hong Kong. I  have an urgent and  very  confidential business proposition for you.  On october 15, 1999, our client Mr. Hatem Kamil Abdul  Fatah who was the deputy governor of Baghdad in Iraq  and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit  for 12 calendar months, with a value of  Fourty  Millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars  only in my branch.  Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even  after the war late this year.   Another notification was sent and still no response  came from him.   We later find out that the Governor has been  assasinated in Baghdad.  The websites below is a verification of the news about  his death:  http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/1/hi/world/middle_east/3970619.stm  http://www.uslaboragainstwar.org/article.php?id=6979  After further investigation it was also discovered  that Mr. Hatem Kamil Abdul Fatah did not declare any  next of kin in his official papers including the paper  work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me  the last time he was at my office that no one except  me knew of his deposit in my bank.  According to the Hong Kong Law,under china's foreign  and defense affairs,at the expiration of 5 (five)  years,such funds will revert to the ownership of the  chinese Government for financing military  operations,such as purchasing of arms and ammunitions  for the military.  In order to avert this negative development,i will  like to seek for your permission as a foreigner to  stand as the next of kin to  Mr. Hatem Kamil Abdul  Fatah so that the fruits of this old man's labor will  not be use for financing weapons which will further  enhance the courses of war in the world in general.  The money will be paid into your account for us to  share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and  10% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the  transaction.There is no risk at all as all the  paperwork  for this transaction will be done by my  attorney and with my position as the credit officer  guarantees the successful execution of this  transaction. If you are interested,please reply  immediately.  Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more   details and that will help you understand the  transaction.  You should observe utmost confidentiality,and rest  assured  that this  transaction would be most  profitable for both of us because I shall require your  assistance to invest my share in your country.  Awaiting your urgent reply.  Thanks and regards.  Mr.Simon Wong.

Barrister  Philip Wilson Dear Friend, I hope this meets you in good health. My name is BarristerPhilip Wilson Esq,legal practitioner and Attorney to late Mr. Ziya Bazhayev who died in the plane crash of Yak-40 jetliner on March 9, 2000. You may follow the Link below to read about the Plane Crash my client lost his life: http://www.amarillonet.com/stories/031500/usn_LA0703.001.shtml,  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/europe/672849.stm My late client was an influential wealthy businessman, a Contractor in my Country and a Russian big time Oil dealer and the Principal owner of Oil Alliance Company and he left behind a deposit of Twenty Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollar ($25,500,000.00USD) in his domiciliary bank account in a commercial bank here in Ivory Coast. Which is one of the main reasons it has been very important to locate his next of kin.  After the death of my client his bankers contacted me, as his Attorney to provide his next of kin who should inherit his fortune. The board of directors of his bank adopted a resolution and I was mandated to provide his next of kin for the payment of this money or forfeit the money to the bank as an abandoned Estate. The bankers had planned to invoke a clause in the property Act, to confiscate the funds after the expiration of a period given to me. It was while i was searching for his family records on the internet  that i came across your contact.I have searched through almost all the genealogy site that you can think of both in the  Russia,USA and all the possible places I thought my clients would have possibly had a family member. Despairing and at the point of desperation, I came across your name, while trying to locate documentation's regarding possible relatives of my client in his country of origin. Convinced that you may be able to act in locus for my late client as his next of kin, I therefore, decided to contact you with these facts before me because of the status quo. By virtue of my brief and my closeness to the deceased, I am very much aware of my client's financial standing and the bank account he operates here in my country. I have reasoned very professionally and I feel it will be legally proper to present you as the next of kin of my deceased client and the sole beneficiary of his estate, so that you are be paid the funds left in his bank account,  hence I contacted you. I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin; the bank needs only the facts as presented legally. The rest is between you and I and with my guide we can have the money paid into your account, once this is done we shall both share the funds. 50% to me and 40% to you, while 10% should be for Taxes as your Government may require, I shall assemble all the necessary Legal Documents that will be used to back up our claim. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through.  I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any Breach of law. Please get in touch with me. Best Regards, Barrister  Philip Wilson Yahoo! India Matrimony: Find your life partner online.

IMPORTANT. Dear friend,  I wish to begin by way of introduction. I am Kenneth Mugaji, the first and  only surviving son of late David Mugaji one of the foremost and rich black  farmers in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country.  Before the death of my father, he had given me the certificate of deposite  he used to deposit the sum of US$30.5 million (Thirty Million Five Hundred  United State Dollars) in one of the private fudiciary companies in the United  Kingdom,as family valuables, when he realized the looming dangers in Zimbabwe.  This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals  for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in land.  This land dispute started when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land reform,  which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few black farmers  (my father included).  This resulted in the gruesome killing of rich farmers (mainly whites) and  the unlawful possession of their properties by Mugabe's war veterans,  under the disguise of fighting for the interest of the country. It is  against this background that I fled the country with my family, to where we are  currently seeking asylum.  I have decided to seek foreign assistance, as the law here prohibits asylum seekers  from operating bank accounts or involve in financial transaction of any kind,   hence this letter to you. All I need is your trustworthiness to be able to entrust  the above said amount and help me with investment opportunities. My family's survival  depends on this money as we have virtually lost all our assets.  There are two options, firstly, you can choose to accept 15% of the total  amount for your assistance or go into partnership for the proper  investment of the money in your country.  We shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when I hear from you.  I await your reply through the above media, while I implore you to  maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free  transaction.  I shall furnish you with more details on request.  Yours truly,  Kenneth Mugaji  N.B.  Please reply me here: (kennethmugaji@mail.az)

Assistance of Transaction.    Dear Friend,   REQUEST FOR URGENT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP IN RESPECT OF THE TRANSFER OF $25,500,000.00(TWENTY-FIVE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED AMERICAN DOLLARS)INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.    I, on behalf of my other colleagues from different Federal Government of Nigeria owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as regards the transfer of the above stated amount into your bank account. This fund arose from the overinvoiced of various contracts awarded in my parastatal to certain foreign contractors sometime ago.     We as holders of sensitive positions in our various parastatal, were mandated by the federal government to scrutinise all payments made to foreign contractors, and discovered that some of the contracts they executed were grossly over invoiced, either by omission or commission. Also, we discovered that the sum of $33,000,000.00(thirty three million American dollars only) was lying in a suspense account, although the foreign contractors were fully paid their entitlements after executing the said contracts. We all agreed that the over-invoiced amount be transferred into a bank account provided by a foreign partner, as the code of conduct of federal civil service does not allow us to operate foreign accounts.      However, we have suceeded in transferring some of the monies, precisely US$7.5(Seven million five Hundred American Dollars) into a foreign account in Morocco (North Africa), but unfortunately the provider of the account has severed all forms of communication with us as he has refused to adhere to our earlier mutual agreement, insisting tha the total amount be paid into his nominated bank account before disbursement will take effect.       We are therefore seeking your assistance based on the balance amount US$25.5M which can be speedily processed and fullyremitted into your nominated bank account. On successful remittance of the funds into your account, you will be compensated with 20% of the amount for your assistance and services.       This transaction is closely knitted and in view of our sensitive positions we cannot afford a slip. I assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free.We will avail you with our identities as regards our respective office when relationship is fully established and smooth operation commences.        I am at your disposition to entertain any questions from you in respect of this transaction, so, contact me immediately through the above email address for further information on the requirements and procedure.        Please note that this is a DEAL and confidentiality is of very great importance for security reasons.        Please treat with strict confidenlity and utmost urgency.        Yours Faithfully,           Dr. Peter Olis. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Encuentra tu casa rápida y cómodamente.

RIGHT OF REPLY RIGHT OF REPLY  Greetings.   I strongly regret any inconvenience the receipt of this letter may   cause you, bearing in mind the nature of its content coming from a   person without any referral, but please read and assimilate its content and objectively consider if we can work together.   I am the head of the account department of a Private Bank in the United Kingdom and I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you.   This involves a client who had an investment placed under our bank's management years ago, the circumstances surrounding the investment made by this client who died interstate, with no known nominated successor in title over this investment made with the Private Banking Branch of my bank has made it very difficult to locate anyone who is directly related to the deceased.   With the very strong feeling that no one will ever come forward to   claim the funds and the investigation coming to a close after several months, the need for an assistance becomes crucial, as a next of kin to the depositor is earnestly being searched for, I have already developed a foolproof, legal and totally risk free means through which the fund can be released to your nominated bank account within a very short time after due documentation and authentication process.   The strategy is to use my position and influence as the Head of the branch and Personal Account officer of the deceased to present you as a next of Kin and beneficiary of the deposit. I want to assure you that I have concluded all local modalities for the successful completion of this within 10 banking days of your agreement to proceed with me as the required assistance is perfected to be 100% risk free. Please reply me to enable us proceed.   I expect your urgent response and if in the affirmative, I shall advice you on what we need to do.  Best regards,   Frank Jones.

The Russian Government had already concluded plans to frozen all the accounts in my boss name (Mikhail Khodorkovsky) both corporate and personal before I connived with an high ranked official of YUKOS OIL,(who is also my partner in this business) to raise a memo stating that YUKOS OIL owe a foreign contractor the sum of 23m US dollars which was finally approved for payment after some deliberations, by the Government of Russia.  YOUR ROLE:  My contact in Yukos Oil will present you as the foreign beneficiary of the above stated sum.

I am Mr. mohamed hassan ,the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my Bank. In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of US$8.5M,(Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with account number 14-2558-5976 that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his wife and only daughter in a plane  crash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261 which crashed on 31 January, 2000.  You shall read more about the crash on visiting this site  The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great industrialist and  a resident of Alaska.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for our bank to release the money to you.  You have to follow the instruction which I will send to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill.  The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after Three years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than three years and I am preparing documentaion to prove that this money has been transfered to our bank treasury. It will be between me and you only that will know that the money is not transfered into our treasure. The request of foreigner  as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Senegalese cannot standas next of kin to a foreigner.  In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering you 30% of the total sum.  5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other charges) likely to be incurred during the course of transaction, while the remaining 65% is for me.  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application which you will complete and forward to our bank asking for this money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thomson.

 assistance ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO.  DEAR SIR/MADAM,  I am Mr. GABRIEL MEDEI, Bank Manager {Hillbrow Branch} of Amalgamated Bank Of South Africa {ABSA}. I got your email contact, in my search for a trusted partner, who will assist me with this confidential business proposal.  Mr. Stev  Jam made a numbered times (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000.00 (twethy- five Million US Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, National Mining Corporation that Mr. Stev Jam died from an auto accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Stev Jam did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$25 M  is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at every end of   each year. No one has come forward to claim it. According to the South African Law, at the expiration of 6{Six} years, the money will devert to the ownership of the South African Government ,if nobody applies to claim the funds.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Stev Jam  so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.                                                                 ;          This is simple   ( 1)  I shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and obtaining the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.  (2) A bank account in any part of the world, which you provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin of Mr. Stev  Jam.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 35%[US$8,750,000:00 DOLLARS] for you then 5% will be set aside for any expenses that may occur during the transfer process. There is no risk at all as the attorney and my position will do all the paperwork for this transaction as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address.  Upon your response shall then provide you with more details for the successful accomplishment of this transaction.  Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply  Thanks and regards  Mr. GABRIEL MEDEI

From Dr. Abraham Maliba DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY & NATURAL RESOURCES SANDTON TOWERS, JOHANNESBURG P.M.B. 12701 SOUTH AFRICA FROM THE DESK OF: Dr. Abraham Maliba M.sc (Manager 14 Project  Allocation)                                                                            CONFIDENTIAL Email: maliba5@702mail.co.za Hello, It is indeed my pleasure to write you this business request. I am writing you to solicit your assistance in a business partnership that could be of mutual benefit to both of us. I hope that you read thoroughly and response as promptly as possible. Precisely, in the year 2000, the Ministry of Minerals and Energy in South Africa where I work as a Manager of 14 Project Allocation, received presidential irrevocable circular order requesting the ministry to compile and forward the list of all past foreign contractors, whose contract payments are pending since the period of the past government of Dr, Nelson Mandela and the present government. The purpose of this presidential order is that the present South Africa elected government will pay foreign contractors all debts owned, and thus maintaining a good relationship with other foreign government and non-governmental financial agencies. In light of the above, my partner and I duty is to compile a list of these contractors. We have decided to include a company name with a bill of {USD25 Million United State Dollars} along side other company names and their respective bill for payments. The {Alliance Mining SA PTY}, which was incorporated for this operation, also carried out contractual works for the ministries as well as others. With the co-operation of top senior partner of mine we are confident that our claim of {USD25Million} shall be granted being for contract work executed at the Ministry of Minerals and Energy, payment shall then be transferred upon approval to a safe account that would be provided by you in other words, if you accept to be our partner then you shall be considered given the pertinent documentation to certify that your company had been awarded a contract already executed, for which your company shall be paid the sum of USD25Million. Please be informed that with the South Africa government monetary policy. Government official's employees are not allowed to operate or to own bank account abroad hence our decision to seek a foreign partner. However, the legitimacy of this transaction is well pronounced, which I will personally explain to you by fax or telephone if you agree to be our partner to determine your true position. I have the authority and consent of my partner to offer this transaction to you. You will be highly compensated with a percentage upon mutual agreement by both parties after a successful completion of this project. Further information concerning the transaction shall be forwarded to you upon your response to this letter. I can assure you that my partners and I are in a position to make this payment claim possible, provided you can give us the assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured. Visualize this opportunity as an indirect financial resource; also note that your area of specialization is not a hindrance in the successful execution of this transaction, endeavour to contact me immediately by the above alternative email address because we will not compromise this transaction with any form of exposure, as we are still in active civil service. Please keep this close to your chest as much as possible; we can not afford any political problems. Thank you and God bless, as I await for a long term mutually beneficially relationship for both of us. Yours Faithfully Dr Abraham Maliba.   
STAND AS THE NEXT OF KIN TO MY LATE CLIENT...? Kosombo  Chamberlee & Associate. 11 Baker Squre Lagos Nigeria. Tel/Fax:234-8035820155. Email address:barr_kok@yahoo.com My Dear: First,I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this by virtue if  its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOPSECRET.Though I know that a   transaction of this magnitude will make  any one apprehensive and worried,  but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. I am  barrister Kofi Kosombo,solicitor at law.I am the personal attorney to Mr   Paul Hamp , a national of your country,who was in contract with shell  development company in Nigeria.On the 21st of April 1999,my client,his wife  And their three Children were involved in  a caraccident along sagbama  express road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I  have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients  extended relatives  this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several  unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his last name over the Internet,  to locate any member of his family  hence I contacted you. I have contacted  you to assist in retrieving the sum of US$10m deposited in a security  company by my client before it get'sconfisicated because the security  company doesn't know that the content of the consignment is cash because on  the day of deposite we declared it as family valuables because we never want  them to know the true content of the consignment. The security company has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or  have the consignment confisicated within the next two weeks and these very  money is too  big for me to allow it to beconfisicated by the authority.  Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over 2  years now I seek your consent to  present you as the next of kin of the  deceased since you have the same last name so that the proceeds of this  consignment valued at 10million dollars can be released to you and then you  and me can share the money. 60% to me and 40% to you I have all necessary  legal documents that can be used to back the claim. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through.  I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that  will protect you from any breach of the law. I am not imposing this  transaction on you,It is a thing of self  willing ness,so it is either you  write me back and tell me you are willing and I will know the next step to  take because this fund must be claimed either with your help  or the help of  somebody else. After going through the proposal and under standing it very  well and you are willing to do this transaction with me,get back to me  immediately so that we can start as follows: 1)I will send to you the contact of the security company,the deposite code,  for you to call for verification if such deposite is really existing. 2)The claim will require both of our physical presentation at the security  company. With constant communication it will not take us more than seven  working days to achieve our aim. It is a promise that at the end of the day you will embrace me and we will  become one family friends for life as I was with my late client.  Your  private telephone is also needed in reponse to this proposal for oral  discussions and better understanding. While I wait for your reply. Best Regard Koffi Kosombo.
I AWAIT YOUR RESPONSE. Dear Friend, I am Bill Franklyn,a Financial Consultant Account portfolio manager based  and working in London UK, working in one of the leading finance houses and I  happen to have managed a particular  account for a Resident Foreigner,here  in the United Kingdom,who died Interstate, leaving in our care a sizeable  amount in a domiciliary United States Dollars Investment Account. For some reasons this client does not have an easily identifiable next of  Kin and I have made several enquiries to locate any of my clients relatives;  immediate and extended, this has proved unsuccessful, hence  I am contacting  you "based on the fact that you have similar names". I need your assistance  in securing the money and property left behind by my client before they get  confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Finance House here in the  United Kingdom. The Finance House has already issued a Government Mandatory  formality notice to provide the Next of Kin or have the account confiscated  and this should expire within a month. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating any of his relatives for over two  years and convinced that no one is coming up and having satisfied the  mandatory  legal requirement of Beneficiary next of kin Notification, I now  seek a Reliable and Trustworthy person,with your consent and perfect  understanding, to present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that the  proceeds of this account initially valued at Twenty One Million, Three  Hundred And Twenty Thousand United States Dollars,($21,320,000) interest not  inclusive, can be paid into an account to be provided by you(preferably)  outside the United Kingdom Financial Institutions or its Isles), as the  perceived Next Of Kin Legally and Otherwise. All I require is your honest cooperation and confidence in me; which I know  would not come easy. I guarantee that this will be executed under a  legitimate background that will protect you from any breach of the law. I would advise that you give this positive consideration and get back to me  soon. I'll be flexible and considerate in the percentage share that will be  given to you for your assistance. Upon receipt of your response we will exchange contact information so that  we can reach each other for further discussions. Regards, Bill Franklyn

CHARITY Hello,  My name is DAVID ELLIS, a nationality of United  Kingdom,I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer.  It has defied all forms of medical treatment, and  right now I have only about a few months to live,  according to medical experts.I have not particularly  lived my life so well, as I never really cared for  anyone(not even myself)but my business. Though I am  very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile  to people and only focused on my business as that was  the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this  as I now know that there is more to life than just  wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I  believe when God gives me a second chance to come to  this world I would live my life a different way from  how I have lived it.  Now that God has called me, I have willed and given  most of my property and assets to my immediate and  extended family members as well as a few close  friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my  soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity  organizations, as I want this to be one of the last  good deeds I do on earth.  So far, I have distributed money to some charity  organizations in the U.A.E, Somalia and Malaysia.  Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot  do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my  family to close one of my accounts and distribute the  money which I have there to charity organization in  Bulgaria and Rwanda, they refused and kept the money  to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as  they seem not to be contended with what I have left  for them.  The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge  cash deposit of Twenty Eight Million USD that I have  with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want  you to help me collect this deposit and despatch it to  charity organizations.  I have set aside 20% for you and for your time.  Please reply to my personal e.mail address ellisd@katamail.com  God be with you.  DAVID ELLIS 
WITH DUE RESPECT FROM DR/BARRISTER KAM IBRAHIM  SENIOR ADVOCATE OF BURKINA FASO (ESQ)  WEST AFRICA.  DEAR FRIEND.  WITH DUE RESPECT, DO NOT BE SURPRISED OR AFRAID TO RECEIVE THIS TYPE OF MESSAGE FROM ME. WELL, I AM BARRISTER KAM IBRAHIM, THE PERSONAL RESIDENT ATTORNEY HERE IN BURKINA FASO TO MR. JOHN KOROVO FROM GERMANY, THE LATE WELL KNOWN BUSINESS MAN, WHO DIED ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY IN JULY 25 2000 IN A SUPER SONIC CONCORD PLANE CRASH AT CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT IN PARIS FRANCE.  MY CLIENT WAS HAVING AN ABANDON SUM OF THIRTY MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATE DOLLARS ($30.5M USD) WITH AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK OF BURKINA FASO.  THE FACT AND CONFIDENTIALLY, THIS SUM KEPT HERE VERY SECRET WHILE NOBODY KNOWS EXCEPT HIS WIFE, AS HE WAS A GOOD BUSINESS MAN, ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN, SO HE KEPT THIS MONEY HERE IN CASE OF EMERGENCY. UNFORTUNATELY HE LOST HIS LIVE WITH HIS FAMILY IN THE EVENT OF THE PLANE CRASH, SINCE THEN I HAVE MADE SEVERAL ENQUIRIES TO LOCATE ANY OF MY CLIENT RELATIVES BUT ALL MY EFFORTS WERE UNSUCCESSFUL.      ABOVE ALL, SINCE NOBODY IS COMING FOR IT AND I DON'T WANT THIS MONEY TO GO INTO THE BANKS TREASURY AS AN UNCLAIMED BILL. BECAUSE THE BANKING LAW AND GUIDELINES HERE STIPULATED THAT IF SUCH MONEY REMAINED UNCLAIMED AFTER FIVE (5) YEARS THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFERRED INTO THE BANK TREASURY AS AN UNCLAIMED FUND.  THE REQUEST OF FOREIGNER AS NEXT OF KIN IN THIS BUSINESS IS OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS A FOREIGNER AND A BURKINABE CANNOT STAND AS NEXT OF KIN TO A FOREIGNER. AFTER ALL THESE, I DECIDED TO TRACE HIS RELATIVES OVER THE INTERNET AND ALSO TRAVELLED TO GERMANY, TO LOCATE ANY MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY BUT OF NO AVAIL, HENCE I CONTACTED YOU TO ASSIST ME IN REPATRIATING THE BALANCE OF LATE MR. JOHN KOROVO LEFT BEHIND TO YOU AS HIS REAL NEXT OF KIN. FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE, I AGREE TO OFFER YOU 30% AS MY FOREIGN PARTNER AFTER THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFER INTO YOUR NOMINATED BANK ACCOUNT AND 10% WILL BE ASIDE OF ANY EXPENSES DURING THE TRANSFER. THEREFORE TO ENABLE THE IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF THE FUND TO YOU AS INDICATED, YOU MUST APPLY FIRST TO THE BANK AS HIS NEXT OF KIN, INDICATING YOUR BANK INFORMATION WHERE THE  MONEY WILL BE REMITTED.      IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO NOTE THAT I HAVE ALL NECESSARY LEGAL DOCUMENTS THAT CAN BE USED TO BACKUP THE CLAIM, ALL I REQUIRE IS YOUR HONEST COOPERATION TO ENABLE US SEEING THIS DEAL THROUGH.  I GUARANTEE THAT THIS WILL BE EXECUTED UNDER A LEGITIMATE ARRANGEMENT THAT WILL PROTECT YOU AND ME FROM ANY BREACH OF THE LAW. I HOPE YOU WILL WELCOME THIS LIFE OPPORTUNITY, IF SO PLEASE GET BACK TO ME IN CONFIRMATION OF YOUR GOOD INTEREST TO ENABLE US STARTS TO PROCEED.  I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU, SO THAT I CAN SEND TO YOU THE TEXT OF APPLICATION WHICH YOU WILL F ILL-IN YOUR DETAILS WHERE THE MONEY WILL BE REMITTED AND TENDER TO THE BANK AS HIS NEXT OF KIN.  THANKS IN ANTICIPATION OF YOUR KIND CO-OPERATION.  BEST REGARDS,  DR/BARRISTER KAM IBRAHIM

Mr William Hello, I am William Wilcox, a private financial consultant /Account portfolio manager. I happen to have managed a particular account for a Resident Foreigner, here in the United Kingdom, who accidentally died Interstate,  leaving in our care a reasonable amount in a Domiciliary United States Dollars Account. The Highly confidential nature of our client and our Business Confidential disposition on Client to client Basis did not warrant us to have an easily identifiable next of Kin to this particular Client. I have made several enquiries to locate any of my client_s relatives immediate and extended, this has proved unsuccessful. Hence, I am contacting you. I need you to assist in securing the money and property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Finance House here in the United Kingdom where his deposits were lodged. The Finance House has issued Government Mandatory Formality, notice to provide the Next of Kin or have the account confiscated within the next one month. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating any of his relatives for over two years and convinced that no one is coming up and having satisfied the mandatory legal requirement of Beneficiary/next of kin Notification, I now seek a Reliable and Trustworthy person, with your consent and perfect understanding, to present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at Twenty One Million, Three Hundred And Twenty Thousand United States Dollars, interest Inclusive, can be paid into an account to be provided by you( preferably outside the United Kingdom Financial Institutions or its Isles), as the perceived Next Of Kin Legally and Otherwise. I have all necessary documents to back up these claims as Next of Kin on your behalf. All I require is your honest cooperation and confidence in me, which I believe that it is not easy, as we have not done similar transaction before and not by reference. Hence the reason I choose to call this a Deal, as it will be based on trust to enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. I would advise that you give this a positive consideration and get back to me soon  I would be very flexible as well as considerate in percentage share that will be given to you for your assistance. Upon receipt of your response l will send to you my private number so that you can reach me for further discussion regarding this project.  Please send mail to my private email for security reasons william_account_2005@walla.com Fax: + 44 207 060 1507 Best regards, William Wilcox. 
I NEED YOUR ASSISTANT  HELLO,  I am contacting you based on a pitiable situation in which I found myself today.  Please find a way to help me out and I will remain grateful.I happened to be a victim of Sudan political crises which has turned me into an orphan and a semi - beggar.At the moment,  I am as confused as hopeless but I believe that this condition is not going to be permanent but what I do not know is when.  My name is Ms.Fatima Fahad from citizen of Sundan, the only daughter of Mr. Modu Fahad.  My father was a business man and well known Gold dealler from Darfur in Sudan. He was murdered in cold blood late last year 2004 ,during the bombing of our village,Rahad Kabolong in the western Sudanese state of North Darfur with my mother .  You can find the story on this website.  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/4007191.stm  My late father Modu Fahad deposited the sum of US$5.500.000.00 Million (Five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) under a custody of Finance Firm Dakar Senegal. However, I came to Senegal with the deposit documents of the money for the claim of the money out from the Finance firm and transfer to a foreign trustee with interest to secure a sustainable investment for my future survival.  I'm therefore soliciting for your assistance to help me receive the money out from Senegal and as well to transfer it into your private or company account for investment in your country under your control,because at my age,i don't have a business idea.  I want you to stand as my fathers foreign busines partner for a successful retrieve and transfer of the money out from Senegal with your name and also help me to secure my traveling documents to come over your country for the investment and to live my future life under your care.  Please reply immediately you receive this mail for further discussion and also tell me the amount you will take as your rewards for helping me to handle the transfer to your position to enable me give you more detail informtion about the deposit.  Thanks for your anticipated understanding and co-operation.  Best regards,  Fatima Fahad. 
Greeting  from henry. Dear friend, Greetings, I am Mr.Henry Okoye the Account Manager of Late Mr.  Morris  Thompson in Standard Trust Bank Regional Office in Victoria island, here  in Lagos.However I got your contact through the International web  directory.I decided to contact you by email because I feel that it is  more secured and private. Recently we discovered a Dormant Account with a huge amount of Money  Valued USD35,000,000.00 (Thirty Five Million Dollars only)that belongs to  one of our late Customer who died in a plane crash .During our  investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very  huge sum of money belonging to Late Mr.  Morris Thompson an American  great  industrialist and a resident of Alaska, who  unfortunately lost  his life in the plane  crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed  on January 31  2000,including his wife and only daughter.  You shall read more news about the crash on  visiting this site which I  got during my  investigation; http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/ and http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html The fund has been dormant in his account With this Bank without any claim  of the funds in our custody either from his family or relation before our  discovery of this development. The Banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for  five years, it will be for feited no the Bank treasury as an unclaimed  bill.It is only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and It is  upon this discovery that I decided to contact you to collaborate with you  to pull out this dormant fund. In order to avert this negative  development, I on behalf of my trusted colleagues now seek your  permission to have you stand in as next of kin to Our late Customer so  that the fund will be released and paid into your account as the  beneficiary.s next of kin now that the bank is still expecting a next of  kin or relative of the deceased ,Late Mr.  Morris Thompson. In fact we could have done this deal alone but because of our position in  this country as civil servants, we are not allowed to operate a foreign  account and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during  the time of transfer since we still work in this bank,this is the actual  reason why we required a second party or fellow who will assist us  forward claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing  bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this fund, even an empty a/c can also serve for this purpose. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% as  gratification for your assisting us, and the remaining 60% will be for me  and my partners. What I want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin. I  have in my possession, all the necessary Documents to successfully  accomplish the operation. Bear in mind that this proposal is 100% risk  free. Further Information will be given to you as soon as I receive your  positive response. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible  stating your wish. Find in the attachment of my Family Picture, to proof  who I am. I await your Urgent Responce,  Regrads, Mr.Henry Okoye

Please permit me to make this plea to you and if interested, do not hesitate to get back to me via my email immediately for further action. Last 4 years, a group of men from Africa were able to move the sum of $15M (Fifteen Million Dollars Only) to one of our branch here in London and since then, none of them have shown up to lay claims on the said amount. Several calls have been made to the owners and none was successful on the numbers given and now I have all the paper work to transfer the funds via our payment office in Berlize to your account without any trace as all documents will be destroyed by me immediately the transfer is taken place after 5 days of receiving your details. Just few days I discovered from the right source that the owner of this money is dead and I have gone through his file and have discovered that he has no Next of Kin to inherit his money. I want to use you as the Next of Kin to enable me transfer the funds ($15M) to your account immediately. Please this is very confidential and must not be discussed with anyone else as I have prepared all my documents to effect the transfer to your account once I have made all changes on the account. Also you will assure me that you will not disappear with the funds hence I make this plea in good faith.I have all the documents gotten from the Registry to put you in place as the Next of Kin. The funds will be shared on 60-40 bases to avoid greed on both sides. If you are interested, get back to me with your contacts now and we shall get this done. Please it is very important to send your response to my private email address:zankjamm@myway.com  Yours faithfully, Mr.Zivko Jannes London-England Reply here only:zankjamm@myway.com
urgent  Dear Sir,  I am Mr. Michael Frein, I work with a finance company here in the United Kingdom.Our company is a frontline finance house with clients all over the World. We are an independent financial institution with most secure operation in keeping financial deposits from any sort of fraud, theft or laundering investigation. Our regulated position has attracted all manner of clientele to our organisation including heads of various governments, top-level executives,etc.  One of our clients, DR. ROBERT DIMITRIS, who was before his death, was an adviser to the Organisation of Petroleum Export Country (OPEC), had over fifty Million pounds lodged with us. On his death five years ago, his heir (his wife) put a claim for his money and my company paid off in line with her request. However,his wife did not know that the facts of Nine million, eight hundred thousand British Pounds (GBP3.8 Million)paid in by DR.ROBERT DIMITRIS in a different account and the money is still lying with us.  I therefore made further investigations and discovered that DR. ROBERT DIMITRIS did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank deposit paperwork in my Financial Institution.This sum of GBP3.8 million is still in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one has and will ever come forward to claim it. According to British law, at the expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Based on my position in this company, I have kept the facts of this case and a few others I am  still watching closely to myself alone.The reason I have decided to contact you is because I am quite certain I can move these funds out immediately but would need your assistance.  What this requires is that you put in an application with a letter of probate, which I will forward to you. This will enable us to open a premium account with my Financial Institution and I will simply make an internal database transfer of the Funds to your account. Once this is done and you will see your new balance, you will put in a claim to have your money.However, due to the fact that my company would not entertain your request to open an account without a proof of the fund origin,  I have without divulging secured the copy of the deposit document of the said fund and will forward it to you when I have your interest in my proposal. On grounds that you agree to do this with me, the money will be shared in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. However, it is quite necessary that these are kept as confidential as possible for its successive completion within days. Please contact me and I will take it from there. Once I hear from you,I will give you access to view DR.ROBERT DIMITRIS account details and you can check  his account statement via the bank s online services to certify what am saying.  Please reply through my email address or I will be expecting your reply.  Sincerely,  Mr. Michael

YOURS IN CHRIST Dearly Beloved in Christ, It is by the grace of God that I received Christ,Having known the truth, I had no choice than to do what  is lawful and right in the sight of God for eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God´s mercy and glory upon my life.I am Mrs Luisa Raymond the wife of Mr George Raymond, my husband worked with the  Chevron/Texaco in Kenya for twenty years before he died in the year 2001.We were married for  twenty-seven years without a child. My Husband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days.  Before his death we were both born again Christians.  Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is  against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US $10.5M. (Ten million Five Hundred Thousand  U.S. Dollars) with a Bank in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the Bank and the management just wrote me  as the beneficiary to come forward to sign for the release of this money or rather issue a letter of authorization to  somebody to receive it on my behalf if I can not come over. Presently, I'm in a hospital in Kenya where I have been undergoing treatment for esophageal cancer.  I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live.  It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations any where in the World.  Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with  the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them. Please, I beg you in the name of God to  help me Stand and collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God fearing that will use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows  propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to  understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that  will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard  earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an  ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know  where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord.  Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any  telephone communication in this regard because of my soundless voice and presence of my husband's  relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are  possible.  As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of Attorney who is in Europe as he will be  the one to assist you in laying claims for this funds. Please reply to my personal mail: luisaraymond637@netscape.net Yours in Christ, Luisa Raymond.

Happy New Year with this transaction Dear Friend Compliments of the seasons This letter is written to you based on contact information I came across on  web while searching for investment options overseas. My name is *Tony Silver  and I work as a manager in an Insurance company here.I discovered one  unclaimed policy for the sum of Twelve Million United States Dollars  {US$12,000,000.00} to be paid out as SURRENDER VALUE for the LIFE ASSURANCE  POLICY of one liquidated oil servicing company by name {CEDRY INCORPORATED}  that went bankrupt nine years ago and does not exist anymore. For us to claim this money, we need a foreigner who will stand as the  manager of the liquidated company to file a claim on this policy using details and  information I will supply. I have made efforts over the years to get any foreign member of the  liquidated company without success. I finally found a lawyer by name  BARRISTER PRINCE VICTOR who was the lawyer/attorney of the liquidated  company. I revealed the unclaimed policy to him and he has accepted to work  with me to get the Surrender value paid to the account of any foreigner I  will provide to stand as the manager of the liquidated company. Barrister  Victor told me that the manager then was very sick during their company�s  liquidation and later died and for that reason no one raised the issue of  their Surrender value with our insurance company. If you accept to stand as the manager or an Assistant manager of the  liquidated Company to claim this surrender value of Twelve million dollars,  I am willing to split the funds into three parts, for each of us having an  equal share of Four Million Dollar. Once you file the claim, we will do the  rest for you in the inside and get the payment released in your name. If you  are interested and capable please get back to me through email. I will send my identifications to you once you indicate your interest to  work with me. There is no risky in your involved because the company has  been liquidated and dissolved and has left Africa for about eight years.This  Barrister Victor and I will come over to your country for our share once  this transaction is concluded. I am optimistic that we will conclude this  transaction within three weeks. Thanks in advance for your anticipated co-operation Regards Mr.Tony Silver

As his  trusted P.A I had employed the services of this particular company  to arrange the shipment of the boxes to Europe on his behalf were  they were to be picked up by a foreign associate of his at that  time, a French man.  This was not the first time I had arranged this kind of shipment for  Mr.Eyadema using this company. The boxes were labeled "photographic  materials" to elude customs and other checks.  Unfortunately, because he was ill-disposed at the time the French  man was no longer able to make the trip to meet with the company's  agents at the destination point. So the agents who accompanied the  boxes had to deposit them in a storage facility pending when he  could come.  On the 5th of February 2005, Mr Eyadema passed on while he was being  evacuated abroad for emergency medical treatment. He had been ill  for some years.  Following the demise of my former Boss, his associate withdrew, so  the boxes have been in storage since then. It was my function to  issue his associates Letters Of Athorization signed by me to pick up  boxes containing valuables and money. They banked money for him in  various pre-selected banks in Europe and Asia. The agents only  assisted the associates in the process to ensure that everything was  done under diplomatic immunity and within the stipulated laws in the  countries where such transactions took place.  I am asking for your assistance and involvement so that we can get  the money for ourselves. I can not do this on my own because i can't  so to say, authorize myself. If you accept to act as an associate of  the Late Mr Eyadema, I can issue to you the Letter of Authorization  for the purpose of reclaiming the boxes on his behalf for our own  benefit. As the beneficiary it will be your responsibility and  obligation (as stated in the coded agreement between the depositor  and the company) to reclaim and repossess the boxes from the storage  facility.  You will be required to meet with the company's assigned agent(s)  personally.  This way you will see the boxes for yourself and sign the necessary  documents to reposses the boxes. The agent(s) will assist you to  bank the funds and then thereafter you can transfer money to other  offshore accounts. This was how itwas done with previous associates.   Or you may choose to arrange something else with the agent(s). If  however you can not meet with any assigned agent, as the  beneficiary/associate to the Late Eyadema,you could request that an  alternative arrangement be made for you. You will have to discuss  this with the agent(s) yourself.  I assure you that everything will go smoothly if you choose to  cooperate with the agent(s). There is no illegality involved here.  If you do decide to get involved then i expect total commitment from  you. If you can do this, i am offering you 3 million dollars as your  own share.  If you are interested in this deal, then contact me immediately via  email(furnished above) for further details. Thank you for your time.  Regards,  Ken Quattara

PLS URGENT REPLY NEEDED MR. HULFUMAN DAVID  GHANA COMMERCIAL  BANK LTD.  19 KOTOBABI AVE.  ACCRA GHANA.  EMAIL>hulfumandav2006002@yahoo.ca  Good Day,  I am Mr.HULFUMAN DAVID, credit officer of ghana  commercial Bank Ltd, accra ghana. I  have an urgent  and  very confidential business proposition for you.  On october 15, 1999, our client Mr. Hatem Kamil Abdul  Fatah who was the deputy governor of Baghdad in Iraq  and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit  for 12 calendar months, with a value of  Fourty  Millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars  only in my branch.  Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even  after the war late this year.  Another notification  was sent and still no response  came from him. We later find out that the Governor has  been  assasinated in Baghdad.  The websites below is a verification of the news about  his death:  http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/1/hi/world/middle_east/3970619.stm  http://www.uslaboragainstwar.org/article.php?id=6979  After further investigation it was also discovered  that Mr. Hatem Kamil Abdul Fatah did not declare any  next of kin in his official papers including the paper  work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in  me,last time he was at my office that no one except  me knew of his deposit in my bank.  According to the ghana Law,under ecowas's foreign and  defense affairs,at the expiration of 5 (five)  years,such funds will revert to the ownership of the  ghanian Government for financing military  operations,such as purchasing of arms and ammunitions  for the military.  In order to avert this negative development,i will  like to seek for your permission as a foreigner to  stand as the next of kin to  Mr. Hatem Kamil Abdul  Fatah so that the fruits of this old man's labor will  not be use for financing weapons which will further  enhance the courses of war in the world in general.  The money will be paid into your account for us to  share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and  10% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the  transaction.There is no risk at all as all the  paperwork  for this transaction will be done by my  attorney and with my position as the credit officer  guarantees the successful execution of this  transaction. If you are interested,please reply  immediately.  Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more  details and that will help you understand the  transaction.  You should observe utmost confidentiality,and rest  assured  that this  transaction would be most  profitable for both of us because I shall require your  assistance to invest my share in your country.  Awaiting your urgent reply.  Thanks and regards.  Mr.HULFUMAN DAVID.  EMAIL>hulfumandav2006002@yahoo.ca 
BUSINESS PROPOSAL AND INVESTMENT IN YOUR COUNTRY FROM:PRINCE HASSAN SULEMAN  TEL:+225 05 618 191  EMAIL:hassan_suleman1970@yahoo.co.in  EMAIL:hassan_suleman1976@yahoo.co.in  ABIDJAN,COTE DIVOIRE.  WEST AFRICA.  Dear Sir,  BUSINESS PROPOSAL AND INVESTMENT IN YOUR COUNTRY  I got your contact through our chember of commerce and  industry.  I am contacting you for a mutual business relationship  and for you to act as my guardian in a joint business  venture that we will operate together.  After praying, my mind asked me to go ahead and  contact you for this partnership.  My name is PRINCE HASSAN SULEMAN, the only son of  Late ALHAJI USMAN SULEMAN. My mother died on the  22nd of October, 1985 of cancer and my father was  assassinated on the 28th of April 2003 by an unknown  person in Abidjan, Cote dIvoire.  My father was a gold and cocoa merchant based in  Ghana/Cote dIvoire.Breifly before he died in a  hospital here in Abidjan, Cote dIvoire due to  injuries he sustained from the gunshots. He told me  about the sum of US$45M(Forty Five Million United States  Dollars) belonging to him in a suspense account with  one of our local Bank here in Abidjan, Cote dIvoire.  That he willed the money to me in his will, with his  attorney. He asked me to seek for a foreign partner  Who will assist me in transferring the money out of  Abidjan, CotedIvoire to a foreign account for  investment purpose. Then help me make arrangement  after the transfer to leave this country. That those  people that killed him may be after me.  According to my late fathers will, the money cannot  be released to me without a foreign partner until at  the age of 37 years. It can only be transferred from  the Bank here to the account of my foreign partner  before I attain the age of 37 years. Presently I am  34years old and can not seat here for the next 3years  waiting for the maturity date, while my life is in  danger. This is my reason for contacting you to assist  me present your self as my foreign partner and also  provide foreign account where this fund will be  transferred to.I have already contacted my fathers  attorney here in respect of this transaction. He is  waiting to hear from my foreign partner for us to  start the process for the transfer of the funds.  I would have done this since but according to our  tradition. I have to wait till its one year after my  fathers death as a mark of respect before embarking  on such project. So that it will not look like if I am  just after his money like my uncle. Since the death of  my father, I have been with my fathers brother in  Ghana. Honestly the way he is treating me, make me  to be suspecting him that he knows some thing about my  late fathers death.  Based on this, I left his house with out his consent.  Presently I am in Abidjan,Cote d Ivoire. He dont  know my way about and will never know. This is why I  need your assistance so urgent for us to finalise this  transaction as soon as possible for me to leave this  Country.  You will be given 40% as compensation for your  assistance and effort before any thing is done with  the money. If you are interested and feel that you  can handle this project. Please get back to me for  more details and as well as indicate your private  Tel/Fax numbers where I can always reach you, when  the need arises.  I await to hear from you.  Thanks and God bless.  PRINCE HASSAN SULEMAN

FROM: PHILIP & ALICE DESMOND  FROM: PHILIP & ALICE DESMOND Rue L195, Zone 4, Abidjan  Ivory Coast. Dear Beloved One, With the hope that you are okay and doing fine, l am contacting you for business transaction.  This proposal could be strange but please give it some attention.  I got your contact details on the internet and i decieded to  contact you first in  good faith.  My name is PHILIP DESMOND, I live in Ivory Coast in West Africa.  I have inherited the sum of USD$27,000,000.00 (Twenty seven million Dollars) from my late parents.  But l am faced with a problem.  It is in respect of this problem that l am contacting you. On the banks documents for the next of kin, my late father appended a clause stating that:  I the next of kin, must attain the age of 35 years, before taking full control of the bank account, But, in the event of war or natural  disasters in Ivory Coast, the bank should honour a transfer request from me which must be for the safety of the funds, And in this case, I must have an investment manager, my investment manager must not be from this country that my investment manager most be a foreigner.   I am only 24 years old now, but Ivory Coast is not a safe country at this time because of the war and the political crisis.  So I want the bank to transfer my money out of Ivory Coast to your account in any  safe country, but the bank is insisting that l fulfil the conditions put down by my late father.   This is actually the reason why l am writing you.   So please I would like you to become my investment manager, because having an investment manager is the condition the bank insist l have to meet before they would agree to transfer my money out to any account.  When you become my investment manager, l would instruct the bank to transfer my money to your account in your country, so that you can help me invest the money wisely while me and my small sister will further our education in your country.  And please tell me what we can invest with this money in your country?  Please I am expecting your response.  If you wish to reply me,Please reach me at this same email address . I am willing to give you 20% of the total money for your assistance.  And please reply with your full contact information for easy communications so that i can send details and the deposit documents to you for better clearifications with the bank contact. My regards, PHILIP DESMOND
Please reply Mrs.Grace Omar Dakar Rep.of Senegal West Africa.  Dear Beloved One.  Thank you for giving me your time;Please be patient and read my email to you, this letter might come as a surprise to you,and you could be wondering where I got your contact.  I got your address through a personal search on the internet for someone relaible and trustworthy,so i decided to contact you for an assistant, which I do hope you will take your time to consider.   I am a widow  to the late principal accountant of Sierra Leon central bank who was assassinated due to political hostility in my country.  For the sake of our lives,my children and i fled to a neighbouring country, Senegal; where we are now seeking refuge.  I must confess to you,our journey to Senegal was not a jolly ride as we encountered a lot of problems,most painful was a particular situation that left us in a state of penury and where we also lost our travelling documents,thereby making  it impossible for us to travel now.  Months ago i was diagnosed with cancer,this futher made our lives more difficult as i am lacking funds to take care of my self and my children.  I decided to contact you,seeking your assistance because i am having problems recovering a large deposit made by my late husband overseas since the company maintained that instructions left by my late husband the original depositor,states that the funds be "RELEASED TO ME HIS WIFE OR A FOREIGN REPRESENTATIVE ONLY", believing he would appoint someone by himself to represent him for the claim but unfortunately he died earlier.  This is the only hope my family has of surviving,paticularly my only son,who has so much dreams and i want to do the best i can to help them fufill thier dreams.  I am contacting you to help me make the claims by representing my husband as the foreign representative,since i cannot travel to make the claims my self due to my present condition,i am pleading with you to help us claim the funds from the security firm and most importantly, your ability to put the said funds into circulation wisely for our joint interest and relocating my children particularly my son is a major considerable factor regarding my request as my knowledge on financial matters is not enough to handle such amount of fund(us$16,000,000.00)  sixteen million dollars.  In view of this, if you are touched to work with me in sincerity, by standing as my late husband,s foreign representative to receive the said deposit on our behalf, we shall embrace you as our family and will compensate you accordingly.  I am willing to share the money 40% for you,40% for me and my children and the remaining 10% we be set aside for any expenses that may be incurred in the course of this transaction,all i really care about now is the welfare of my children.  As you indicate interest, please contact my son ANTA OMAR on this email address (an_omar07@yahoo.fr)or call him on his phone number Tel:  +221-4488469  to enable him give you further information relating to the funds and the steps we shall take to finalize on the project,i have handed this project to him as my health conditions makes it hard for me to talk or go around.  Thanking you in advance for your kind and urgent response, more so for keeping our proposal to your self. Sincerely Grace Omar.
FROM MR ABDUL LAWAL (HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU) FROM MR ABDUL LAWAL STANDARD TRUST BANK OF BENIN REPUBLIC OF BENIN. WEST AFRICA. DEAR FRIEND, I am MR.ABDUL LAWAL,the director in charge of auditing and accounting section of standard trust Bank of Benin republic in West Africa with due respect and regard. i have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on 30th january 2000 on Kenya Airways with aircraft Airbus 310-304 at location Abidjan, Ivory Coast, with registration number 5Y-BE while travelling with his entire family, his wife, two children and a maid on a festive visit to Abidjan and since his untimely death the funds has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our ustody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development. Although personally, I kept this information secret within myself and partners to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amount was USD$24.1M (twenty four Million one Hundred Thousand united states dollars). may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through my good friend who works with chamber of commerce on foreign business relations here in Cotonou-Benin, it is him who recommended your person to me to be viable and capable to champion a business of such magnitude without any problem. Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased and get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place, all directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit yourself to this great business opportunity.In fact i could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant, we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because i work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designated bank account. May i at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as i have made all arrangements for a successful transaction as an insider of the bank before contacting you.On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of any expenses that may arise during the time of transfer like telephone bills, fax and our travel tickets to come over to your country for the sharing of the fund while 60% will be for me and my partners. Please you have been advised to keep this a top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment either in your country or any country you will advice us to invest in.All other necessary information will be sent to you on your acceptance to champion this transaction with me.I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible in this deal. Yours faithfully, Mr.ABDUL LAWAL Reply To:abdullawal1967@hotmail.com
CRY FOR HELP Dear Sir,/Madam , I am Princess Adama Williams, daughter of HRH King Solomon Abonmie Williams, the king of Ogoni Kingdom. I am 28 years old and a graduate of Mass Communication. My father was the king of Ogoni Kingdom the highest oil producing area in Nigeria. He was in charge of reviving royalties from the multi-national oil companies and government on behalf of the oil producing communities in Nigeria.  After the hanging of the Ogoni Nine(9) including Ken Saro Wave by the late director General Sani Abacha, my father suffered stroke and died in August 27th last year. But before his death, he called me and told me he has Twenty Three Million Five Hundred and Sixty Thousand Dollars (USD23, 560,000.00) cash in his possession, specially deposited in a Security vault company in London. He advised me not to tell anybody except my mother who is the last wife of the (8) eight wives that he married. My mother did not bear any male child for him. Which implies that all my father'properties, Companies e.g., we have no share in them because my mother has no male child according to African Tradition. My father therefore secretly gave me all the relevant documents of the said money, and told me that I should use this money with my mother and my younger sisters because he knows that traditionally; if he dies we cannot get anything, as inheritance. He importantly advised me that I should seek foreign assistance and that I should not invest this money here in Nigeria because of his other wives and male children who happen to be my elders. I am soliciting for your immediate assistance to get a Bungalow for us, where I will live with my mother and two younger sisters and further advise me where and how I will invest the balance money overseas, possibly on products of your company and other profitable ventures. I believe that by the special grace of God, you will help us move this money out of London to any country of your choice where we can invest this money judiciously with you. You are entitled to a reasonable part of this money based on our agreement, and God will bless you as you help us. Please reply through my e-mail Looking forward to hear from you as soon as possible. sent to thie email; williamsng1@wanadoo.es Regards. Princess Adama  Williams.

KIND UNDERSTANING FROM MR BINEY Please reply to my private email address  From: Mr Biney I Saac  Private Email:wilsonjohn_biney2@she.com  Attn:The Managing Director  Am Mr. BINEY ISAAC I, I am in charge of Cargo section of ROCHASAB Security  Banglamung Thailand. With due respect and regards I have decided to contact  you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us of  the end of the transaction.  During our investigation and auditing in this security company my department  came across a consignment belonging to a deceased person who died on plane  crash with this security company without any claim of the consignment in our  custody either form his family or relation before our discovery to this development.  Although personally, I kept this information secret within myself and partner  to enable the whole plans and ides be profitable and successful during the  time if execution, the said amount was US$5.6M (FIVE Million SIX Hundred  thousand United State Dollars).  As it may be interest to you to know, I got your impressive information  through my good friend who works with chamber of commerce here in Thailand.  Mean while all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonfire next of kin to the deceased, will be relayed to you as soon as you  indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit yourself  to this great deal. In fact I could have done this deal alone but  because of my position in this country as a civil servant, we are not  allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eyebrow on  my side during the time of transfer because I work in this company.  This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who  will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to  the security company and also present a foreign account where he will need  the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due  verification and clarification by designation back account.  I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On  smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the  total sum as gratification, while 10% we be set aside to take care of  expenses that may arise during the fine of transfer and also telephone  bills, while 60% will be for me and by partners.  Please, you have been advised to keep top secret as we are still in service  and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.  I will write application to rinsing out have the company and join business.  And it will require us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing  of this found according to percentages previously indicated and further  investment either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in.  All other necessary information will be sent to you when I heard from you  I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this  deal.  Yours faithfully,  Mr. Biney Isaac. 
help sir Permit me to first of all introduce myself.  My name is Kenneth.c. Ndlovu, the eldest child of Mr Tarcisious Ndlovu from Zimbabwe.         During the current crisis against the farmers of Zimbabwe by the  supporters> of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the  white owned farms in our country, he ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms to his party members > and their followers.My father was one of the best farmers in the country and> knowing that he did not support the president's > political ideology, the president's supporters invaded my father's farm burnt down everything, killed him and confiscated all his investments.         After the death of my father, my mother and I with my younger sister  decided to move out of Zimbabwe for the safety of our lives.  Before we moved, we were able to, with the assistance of a diplomat friend of  my late father send the money> my father kept in the safe in my mother's house,  which amounted to the sum of US$24.7 Million United States Dollars to Overseas. The diplomat, my father?s friend assited us in sending the money via Diplomatic  courier. The funds are presently being kept away in the secret vaults of a private  security firm based in overseas  The officials of the firm are also not aware of the contents of the package  and are of the belief that they are helping me in keeping my personal Valuables,  because> of the way I packaged the consignment as family  valuables.  Myself and my mother then decided to contact any reliable overseas Partner who  could assist us to collect and transfer this money out of the Security company  to a safe account nominated by such a person, because we as asylum seekers here  in South Africa we are handicapped in doing this because our status here  does not permit us to a lot of facilities.  If my proposition is considered, for assisting us in this transaction, we intend to  share funds in the ratio of 75% for me and my family, 20% for you then 5%  will be set aside to cover any expenses incurred during this transaction.  There is no risk at all, as all the documents for the success of this transaction I  will forward to you. If you are interested, please reply immediately to this. kenc1962@mail.nu   Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant   documents that will help you understand. Please observe utmost confidentiality,  and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us  because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.  You can also visit the sites below to give you an insight of the injustice done to  white farmers in my country.  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2787057.stm  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2571697.stm  Awaiting your urgent reply  Thanks and regards  Kenneth .c.

My name is Nena Donald. I am the only daugther of Late General Frank Donald the former Director of military inteligence and special acting General Manager of the Sieria Leone Diamond mining coperation(SLDMC ). I am contacting you to seek your good assistance to transfer and invest (USD 10. million) belonging to my late father which is deposited in a bank in Abidjan. This money is revenues from solid minirals and dimonds sale which were under my fathers possession before the civil war broke out. Following the brake out of the war, almost all government offices, coperations and parastatals were attacked and vandalized.  The SLDMC was loothed and burnt down to ashes, and diamonds worth millions of dollars was stolen by the rebel military forces who attacked my fathers office. Many top government officials and senior army officers were assasinated and my father was a key target because of his very sensitive military possition and appointment in the SLDMC.  Regreatably, my father was captured and murdered along with half brother in cool blood during a mid-night rebel shoot-out when our official residence in freetown was armbushed by Fordey Sanko the notorious rebel leader. My mother sustainded very sever bullet injuries which resulted to her untimelyand painful death in a private hospital here in Ivory Coast. Now I am alone in a totally strange country without parents, relatives or any body to care for me at my tender ages.  Before my mother died, she told me that my father deposited some money which he made from diamond sales and contracts at this bank here in Ivory Coast and that i should pray and find a trustworthy foreign business partner who would help me to transfer and invest this money in profitable business venture overseas. She told me to do this quickly so that i can leave Ivory Coast with my cousin brother-Arthur who is here in the camp with me and, then settle down abroad.  She gave to me all the bank documents to prove the deposit and then told me that my father used my name as the only daugther to deposit the money in the bank. She told me that this is the reason why we came to Ivory Coast. My mother died afterwards. May her soul rest in perfect peace.  I have gone to the bank to make inquires about this money and I spoke with the director of International remittance who assured me that the everything is intact and promised to help me transfer this money to my foreign partners bank account as soon as I provide my partners foreign bank account for them. However, the director is very concerned because of my age, I am 23 years and as such promised to help me and he would like to speak with my partner to ensure that this money is invested wisely in only profitable business because of his personal interest and sympathy for me.  If you are will to assist me, please let me know immediately and provide me with your following information for bank here: 1. Your full names and address, tel/ fax 2. Name of Bank and addres, Tel/fax/telex 3. Account name and number and 4. swift code etc. Please note that I can only offer you 10% of the total money as compensation for your noble assistance in accodiance with my mothers advise. I am interested in any profitable commercial venture which you consider very good in your country and you would also get a school for me and cousin so that we can finish our colledge education.  I am hoping to hear your urgent response so that I can not look for another foreign partner. Thank you and may God bless you and your dear family. Yours sincerely Nena Donald.

YOUR  URGENT REPLY  IS  HIGHLY  NEEDED Dear Friend,  I am Dr.Micheal Dudu. of Logistics officers of (W.E.A.C. A) West African Control Authorities Dakar Senegal , with due honour I am contacting you in the respect of fund to be transfer to your account. This fund belongs to Mr. Robbin Marvin, Inview of the above we are working as the International Monitoring Committee here in the West Africa, and we monitor every out going and incoming huge fund that was leaving every bank from the West African States to any destination in the whole world. And this organization was empowered by the USA Government (NDLEA) National Drug Law Enforcement Agency after (911) September 11 2001 bomb blast in United State of America, to make sure that every fund that was leaving the West African region has no relationship with Anti Drug Law or Terrorism.  This sum of $17.8 M USD (Seventeen Million Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) is still in our correspondent Bank where it was held prior for transfer after the investigation before the report came to us that he died, and since then no one has come forward to claim it since the report of his sudden death. Mr Robbin Marvin of United States of America's fund has proved legitimate. According to the rules and stipulation of the organization of WEACA at the expiration of 7 (seven) weeks from now, the money will be re-called back to the Central Bank of Senegal if nobody applies to claim the funds as a cousin or beneficiary next of kin to Mr Robbin. Based on my position in this organization, I have kept the facts of this case I am still watching closely to myself alone.The reason I have decided to contact you is because I am quite certain I can move these funds out immediately but would need your assistance. What this requires is that you put in an application of claim into this fund with my guide line. This will enable the Bank where the money was held to open a premium account and make an internal database transfer of the Funds to your account.  However, in the fact that our European Bank may not entertain your request to open an account without a proof of the fund origin, I will without divulging forward to you the whole documents of the said fund and will forward it to you when I have your interest in this matter, On grounds that you agree to do this with me, the money will be shared in the ratio of 60% for me and the chief executive and protocol officer of WAECA who is the only peoples that knows the fact and origin of this fund then 40% for you. It is quite necessary that these are kept as confidential as possible for its successive completion. Please contact me and I will take it from there.  Once I hear from you,I will give you all the paper that will lead you to our Correspondent bank Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s online service the Europe.  Please reply through my email request. I will be expecting  your reply,  NAME..................................  MAILING  ADDRESS.......................  AGE:..................................  STATUS:...............................

DR .ABU TOPIA Dear, I am the head of Accounts and Audit Department of Bank of Africa, Ouagadougou . I decided to contact you after a careful thought that you may  be capable of handling this business transaction which i explained below; In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $10.5m US dollars (Ten  million, five hundred thousand US dollars). In an account that belongs to  one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in 1998 in  a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been  expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot  release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the  deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt  that his supposed next of kin(his son and wife) died alongside with him at  the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim . It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my  department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the  money to you as the next of kin (We want to present you as his busines  asociate )to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since  nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the Bank  treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  Unclaimed after seven years, the money will be transferred into the Bank  treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this  business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a  Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner .We agree that 30% of  this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision  of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incurred during  the business and 60% would be for me and my colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement  according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate  transfer of this fund to your account as arranged,you must apply first to  the bank as next of kin of the deceased customer. Upon receipt of your  reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I  will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free  and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required  arrangements have been made for the transfer. I expect that you contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Hoping to hear from you immediately. Yours faithfully, DR .ABU TOPIA _________________________________________________________________ Retrouvez tout en un clin d'oeil avec la barre d'outil MSN Search !  http://desktop.msn.fr/
IN DESPERATE NEED OF YOUR CO-OPERATION!  Steve Moore(col.)  Osnabrueck,Germany  Attention Pls.,  IN DESPERATE NEED OF YOUR CO-OPERATION!  I write you this letter from Detention to solicit your help, as I am in dire need of your co-operation in this urgent matter.  I am Steve Moore, a Colonel in The Coalition Army(country detail will be given after introduction and proper establishment  of trust) deployed to Iraq in the wake of the change of the Sadam Hussein Regime in Iraq. I served there until I was  arrested and detained in connection with the Iraqi prisoner abuse scandal in 2004. I was previously attached to a Military  Base in Osnabrueck,Germany before my deployment to Iraq. I am presently at a detention facility in Osnabrueck,Germany.  In the course of my stay in Iraq,I have withnessed so much looting from which many colleagues have benefited in excess  of some millions of Dollars. After a long hesitation, I decided to grab the opportunity that God had given me by placeing me  in charge of the Security of all the recovered money.  This is a part of the money that the regime of Sadam Hussein,their friends and cronies had stolen and hidden in various parts  of Iraq before the war.It became the responsibility of the Allied soldiers to search for,recover this money and plough it back  into the governance of Iraq. In the proccess of securing the money running into hundreds of millions of US Dollars,we were  able to keep some away for ourselves. Thats how the money came about.  Everything went well until I was accused in 2004 alongside other colleagues suspected to have abused inmates of prisons  under the control of Allied Forces in Iraq.  I initially thought that my stay in prison awaiting trial would be brief but I have spent some time here without any change in  my hopeless situation! Now that I dont know how long I would stay here,and faced with the possibility of dismissal from the  Army if I am found guilty,I have come to accept that it is only proper to try and make some kind of reliable contact who could  help me pick up and safe-keep this money so that I dont lose everything I have saved during my stay in Iraq.Who knows;such  an opportunity,they say, comes once in a lifetime!  I just need a guarantee of trust from you because there have been cases of breach of trust in the past by contacts that some  of my colleagues have fronted for such transactions.I have presently,the sum of US$41.7m already shipped to safety somewhere  in Europe. I only need you to guarantie me that I can still get this money back,if it is remitted to you. I need a person I can trust  to safeguard this money since it is not possible to leave here and do it myself. All the arragerment to guarantee you a safe  access to the money has been made by me before my arrest.Your only part is to receive and safeguard it. We would further  discuss on how the money should be disbursed afterwards.  For your role in this business,I wish to compensate you handsomely on successful conclussion of this assignment.I must only  not forget to tell you that confidentiality in this business is very important to both parties.  I did not include my phone contact because any phone contact is for the military prison and therefore,not safe.This e-mail  address is the only reliable private contact I have here for now.I also have the right to occassional access to phone and internet  for recreational purposes though the chances are limited.I implore you to consider this proposal as urgently as possible and give  me a feedback so that we can expedite action in good time. If you are in favour of my proposal,please,do include your private  contact information - phone,email address to facilitate a more effective and confidential communication.I implore you to ponder  over this proposal as urgently as possible and get back to me.  Do not forget to pray fervently for my acquitance.I wish you the best as  I await your reply.  Thanks,  Best Regards,  Steve Moore(Col). 
BUSINESS PROPOSAL (ASSISTANCE REQUIRED) BANK OF AMERICA (ASIA)LTD. 17/F DEVCON HOUSE 979 KING'S ROAD HONG KONG. Dear Friend, I am Joseph Wong, credit officer of Bank of America (Asia) Ltd, Hong Kong. I  have an urgent and  very confidential business proposition for you. On october 6, 2001, an American Engineer/Consultant with  the Chinese Solid  Minerals Corporation,Mr. Steinmetz Horst made a (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$40,500,000.00 (Forty Million  Five Hundred thousand United State Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity,I sent a routine  notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we  sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the  Hong Kong Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr. Steinmetz Horst died from a recurrent heart disease. On further investigation,I found out that he died  without making  a will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was  fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that  Mr. Steinmetz Horst did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his  official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$40,500,000.00 is still lingering in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the Hong Kong Law,under china's foreign and defense affairs,at the expiration of 5 (five) years,such funds will revert to the ownership of the chinese Government for financing military operations,such as purchasing of arms and ammunitions for the military. In order to avert this negative development,i will like to seek for your permission as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Steinmetz Horst so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not be use for financing weapons which will further enhance the courses of war in the world in general. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and 10% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the transaction.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork  for this project will be done by my attorney and with my position as the credit officer guarantees the successful execution of this project. If you are interested,please reply immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more  details and that will help you understand the transaction. You should observe utmost confidentiality,and rest assured  that this  project would be most profitable for both parties because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Thanks and regards. Mr. Joseph Wong.

INVESTMENT NEGOTIATION TO THE M/D " RS ATIYA MOHAMEED  Dear.Md         It is my pleasure to write this mail to you and to say thanks for your effort in providing an opportunity to read my mail. I got your contact when i was making some searches in the internet.  My name is Mrs Atiya Mohameed, a Liberian. I was until recently the wife of Mr. Ibrahim Mohameed  who was the chief army officer to my country Libera. I am contacting you  to seek your co-operation in investing $USD10.M in your company or your country,s economy.  My  husband made this money when he was on sit as the commander and chief army officer while  Charles Taylor is the president  of Liberia.  Due to some religious and political problems , my husband was  hijacked and brutally assasainated by the rebel leathers in Liberia.  It is worthy to note that during my husband's life time he used his position as a former chief aid to must have made this money in question.  This money was realised from  the sales of gold and diamond ,which are the country's major resources and sources of income.And before his death ,my husband was able to send this money via a Ghanian diplomatic contact to the country ,where it is currently secured with a security company as a FAMILY  TREASURE   and  my name was used as the depositor in view of my husband,s position as an insider in the government.  And it was my husband,s refusal to realise the money to former President Charles Taylor that resulted in the killing in February 2003.  Now , that i have passed through the mourning ordeal for my husband  I am   thinking and planning the next step to take with respect to how  and where  to invest the money.  So my aim of sending this mail to you is to solicit your assistance in transfering this money to your country where it could be invested in a viable business for our mutual benefit. I am ready to enter into a joint venture with your company or we can open a new company with the money because i'm sure the money inside the box can establish a company of any type.  I want to assure you that you will be highly rewarded for your assistance both in cash or in the joint venture.  Please reply to this mail, indicating your ability to handle this transaction so that i will give you details to enable us map out strategies for the implementation of this project.  Best regards,  Mrs.Atiya Mohameed

Dearest in Christ, pls treat with a honest mind Dearest in Christ, pls treat with a honest mind Calvary greeting to you and your family. My name is Mrs bene jones, a scottish, but I am married to Mr jones who is the Managing Director of Shell Petro-Chemical Company, before he died in the plane crash of Oct  23, 2005 with Bellview Airlines twin-engine Boeing 737] with other  passengers aboard all 117 passage died, as you can confirm it yourself  through this website http://edition.cnn. com/2005/WORLD/africa/10/23/nigeria.plane/ http://www.washingtonpost. com/wpdyn/content/article/2005/10/23/AR2005102300368.html  We were  married for eleven years without a child. Before the death we were both  born again Christians. When my late husband was alive we deposited the  sum of USD$16.5Million (Sixteen Million Five hundred thosand U.S.  Dollars) with one of good bank here in Nigeria. Presently, this money  is still with Union Bank of Nigeria. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three  months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my  stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to  church or better still Christian individual that will utilize this  money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church that will use this fund to churches, orphanages,  Research centres and widows propagating the word of God and to ensured  that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand  that blessed is the hand that griveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit  this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don;t want  my family hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers.I don't want a  situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the  reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I  know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the  Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall  hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard  because of my health because of the presence of my family relatives  around me always. I don't want them to know about this development.With  God all things are possible.  As soon as I receive your reply. Ishall  give you the contact information of the bank and whom to contact.

URGENT RESPONSE NEEDED URGENT RESPONSE NEEDED  FROM: BRIAN SMITH  Dear friend,  I am Brian Smith Esq, my client is one of the top Managers of Midland   Bank London Branch and his colleague in the same bank here in the   United Kingdom have an urgentand very confidential business proposition   for you. On June 6th, 2001, a Chinese business man, Mr.CHOW LIU,   deposited in his personal safety deposit vault currency valued at   £17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million, Five Hundred Thousand British Pound   Sterling) in my client's branch.  Upon expiration of the period of   leasehold of his safety deposit vault two years ago, my client sent a   routine notification to   his forwarding address but got no reply.  Some months ago, a reminder was sent and finally it was discovered he   had passed away. On further investigation, it was discovered that he   did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were   fruitless. Further investigations revealed that Mr. CHOW LIU did not   declare   any next-of- kin in all his official documents in my clients' bank.   This sum of £17,500,000.00 is still in the Vault which was opened and   the keys changed upon the expiration of the period of leaseholdby   myclients.  Consequently, my proposal is that myclients will like you   as a   foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. CHOW LIU.   This is simple. I will like you to provide me immediately with your   full names and address so that by virtue of my position as an attorney,   I will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put   you in place as the next of kin.  I shall do the drafting and   notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter   of probate/administration in your favor form the shipment of the funds   through a courrier company to you. The money will be shipped by courier   to you for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and my clients and   20% for you.   I hope that is okay.  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for   this transaction will be done by me as an attorney and the position of   my client as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of   this transaction. If you areinterested, please reply immediately via   email:- brian_smith650@hotmail.com  If on the other hand you are not   interested please disregard this mail and I will not contact you   again.  Upon your response, I shall then provide you with my phone   number, more details of the transaction and the relevant documents that   will help you   understand.  Please observe utmost confidentiality and be restassured that this   transaction would be most profitable for all of us.  Best regards,  Brian Smith (Esq). 
FROM MR ABDULLAZEEZ (BUSINESS PROPOSAL) FROM MR ABDUL LAZEEZ STANDARD TRUST BANK OF BENIN REPUBLIC OF BENIN.  WEST AFRICA. DEAR FRIEND   I am MR ABDUL LAZEEZ, the director in charge of auditing and accounting section of Standard trust bank of Benin cotonou Republic of Benin in West Africa with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction .  During our investigation and auditing in this bank,my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in (beirut-bound charter jet) plane crash on the 25th December 2003 here in cotonou (replublic of benin) and since his untimely death the funds has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got during my investigation; (http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/index.html).  Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself and partners to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amount was US$24.1M(Twenty Four million One Hundred Thousand united states dollars).  As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through a friends who works with the Ministry of Information here in Cotonou-Benin.  It is him who recommended your person to me to be viable and capable to champion a business of such magnitude without any problem .Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased,get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit yourself to this great business opportunity.  In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant,we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designated bank account.  May I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as I have made arrangements for a successful arrangement as an insider of the bank before contacting you. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone bills, while 60% will be for me and my partners.  Please, you have been adviced to keep this a top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.  I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in.  All other necessary information will be sent to you on your acceptance to champion this transaction with me.  I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible on my personal email address stating your wish in this deal.  Yours faithfully,  Mr ABDUL LAZEEZ Reply To:mrabdullazeez@hotmail.com

GET BACK TO ME From: Frank Siaka  +27 73 260 3786 Dear Sir,  I should appreciate your surprise while receiving this letter. In any case,I am left with no option but to contact you in this manner. my decision to write to you was informed by knowledge that being established personally that you could be disposed to understand my predicament in order to give me the assistance I require I am Frank Siaka the son of a late Sierra-Leonian businessman, late Dr.Coleman Siaka the owner of (RMS) Mining Company in Sierra-Leone, who died few years ago when the Revolutionary United Front Rebels (R.U.F) attacked our residence on the 11 of Feb. 2004 in Makeni Sierra-Leone. Following the cease fire agreement which was reached last year with the help of United Nation peace keeping troops, I used the opportunity to leave the country with a very important document of (US$ 7,650,000.00) Seven Million Six Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars, deposited by my late father in Security Company in South Africa, under my name. This money was realized from diamond export, now I and my mother are seeking asylum in South Africa under (UNHCR). I contacted you because of the need to deal with person whom my family and I have no previous personal relationships, and I confirmed your country as being economic conducive for investment and her people as transparent and trust-worthy to engage in business, hence my reason for writing you however, this money in question has been in the security company since his death. But my main problem now is that at my age of 28yrs, I am confused on how to handle this huge amount of money and also what to do with it as I don't have anyone to confide in South Africa here. May I use this medium to request from you if you will be disposed enough to help me keep this huge amount in your country or any other place of your choice that will have more security to the money and the life of me and my family? I have met the security company with the depositional documents that my father left behind, of which my name appears as the "Next Of Kin”, the company awaits my coming for the withdrawal, and I am even afraid of disclosing the content to them since my father in his letter had warned me against that. If it appeals to you to help me, I will suggest you take a trip to South Africa for us to meet face to face and finalize before moving the fund or if there is any other means you can suggest for the transferring of the fund to your very position pending my arrival to meet with you for investing of the money with any profitable business you introduce, as I have decided to do away with Africa entirely. I want immediate confirmation of your through our e-mail address. As soon as I get your response I shall give out more details on how we shall proceed. Kindly keep this proposal strictly confidential because of our present status here in South Africa. Thanks and remain blessed. I wait to receive a favorable response from you urgently. Yours faithfully,  Frank Siaka

A RELIABLE PARTNER CONTRACTS VERIFICATION N. N. P. C  ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO  Dear friend,  l am Dr Mallam Galadima., the contracts verification manager of  Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Because of my position  and that of other strategic officials who are heads in their  Departments, we have in our possession, since 2001 the sum of US$400M  Dolllars (Four hundred million United States Dollars) which we emassed  through over invoicing of foreign contracts fully executed and  commissioned with the different foreign contractors duely paid their  full contract amounts. We have made several fruitless moves to  transfer this fund abroad for our mutual benefits. One in 2002 when one  Mr. Lambert Brown of the United States of America, living at No 125 N.  Kinsley Ave. Ocean City, NJ 082216, ran away with our US$65M Dollars  after the fund has been transfered into his account. lt was  unbelievable, shocking and hypertensive that when we went there to  claim our share of the fund, we were told that nobody with that name  was living in that house and that the former occupant of the flat moved  away few weeks ago to an unkown house. This is how we lost US$65M  Dollars to the heartless Mr. Lambert Brown.  The second attempt was  when in 2003, we decided to carry US$50M dollars in cash through the  Lagos lnternational Airport but was stopped by the Nigerian Custom  Officers who seized the fund till date . This is how we lost another  US$50M Dollars to the Nigerian Custom.  Following the peaceful life  ushered in by the current democratic dispensation in Nigeria, l and my  colleages have decided to transfer the sum of US$22M (Twenty Two  Million dollars) into a foreign account operated by a foreigner for our  mutual benefits. By this letter, l request your assistance in  transferring and safeguarding the sum of US$22M Dollars for our mutual  benefits.  For assisting us in transferring and safeguarding this  fund, you will be entitled to 35% of the total sum 5% will be set aside  for charity and philantropic purposes 57% belongs to me and my  colleagues while 3% will go for reimbursement of all expenses made by  both parties. However, l want you to be human and humane so that you do  not become this second Mr. Lambert Brown of the United States. lt is  imperative to note that this transaction is risk free as all modalities  for the successful transfer of this fund have been perfected by my  colleagues in the relevant ministries.  However, we should see  absolute confidentiality as our watchword throughout the course of this  transaction for we are civil servants and will equally not like the  2002 event to redramatise itself.  l will not be ungrateful if you can  urgently furnish me with your private telephone, fax and mobile numbers  and name of beneficiary with the telex numbers of the receiving bank.  These will enable us speed up the claim of the fund and eventual  transfer into your nominated account. Please reply via this alternative  email address:mallamgaladima59@yahoo.com  Looking forward to hear from  you soonest.  Dr.Mallam Galadima

PLEASE READ AND GET BACK TO ME Dear Friend  This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I   believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and   business partners.   I am Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN, currently Head of   Corporate affairs with a reputable bank here in Dubai -U. A. E. I write   you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with   the information I am about to reveal to you.  I have an urgent and very   confidential business proposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an   Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM   CORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) for 36   calendar months, valued at  US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five   hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his   account officer before I was moved to my present position recently.     Upon maturity in 2003, as his account officer and as well the bank   manger, it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a   routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was   returned undelivered.   After sometime, I tried sending back the   letter, but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his   contract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Khalil Al   Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein   (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his country Iraq,   as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. On further   investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nasser’s family wife and two   sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not   declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents,   including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any   WILL. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under   dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have   heard from the owner since 2003.   I wish to let you know that all the   investigation I have made so far, my bank management is not aware of   it, I am the only one that have the information.  With the recent change   of government in my country and with their efforts to support the   United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. By end of   this year, the government will pass a new financial control law which   will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of   above $5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it   is not for terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the   country immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely   confiscate the money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner   to explain the source of the money. I cannot directly transfer out this   money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting   you for an assistance.   As the Account Officer to late Al Nasser,   coupled with my present position and status in the bank as Head of   Retail Banking Group, I have the power to influence the release of the   funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account,   with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give   you. All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully   worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction   will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you   from any breach of law, beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes.  If   you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to   share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied.   If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message   so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God   bless you.   Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send   you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when the   deposit was made for your perusal.   I wait your urgent reply through my   private emailaddress:  Regards,   Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN.

During the current crises against the farmers of Zimbabwe by the supporters of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned  farms in my country,  he ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms to his party members and their followers.

After the death of my father, my mother and I together with my younger brother decided to move out of Zimbabwe for the safety of our lives. On our departure from Zimbabwe,we took along with us some money which my father kept in the safe in my mother?s custody which amounted to the sum of US$15,000,000.00 (FIFTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) to the Republic of South Africa where we have deposited it as personal valuables in a private security company and sought  for political asylum.

I got your contact address from the South African Chambers of Commerce and Industry please don't worry. During the current crises against the farmers of Zimbabwe by the supporters of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned  farms in my country,  he ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms to his party members and their followers. My father  was one of the biggest farmers in the country and although a black indegene, he did not support the President?s  political ideology.Therefore, the president?s supporters invaded my father?s farm burnt  down everything, killed him and confiscated all his investments. After the death of my father, my mother and I together with my younger brother decided to move out of Zimbabwe for the safety of our lives. On our departure from Zimbabwe,we took along with us some money which my father kept in the safe in my mother?s custody which amounted to the sum of US$15,000,000.00 (FIFTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) to the Republic of South Africa where we have deposited it as personal valuables in a private security company and sought  for political asylum. My mother has  suggested and I agree that we have to further move out of the African continent to overseas for actual  safety and to do reliable business investments. Therefore we have decided that I should contact any reliable overseas person/firm/company who could  assist us to transfer this money out of South Africa through a current investment account because as refugees  we are not allowed to operate any account exceeding US$2,000(Two Thousand US Dollars). So we need your help to come down to South Africa to open a bank account through which we can transfer this money to your country.If my proposal is considered,  for assisting us to Transfer this money to your country, we unanimously agree to offer you 20% of the  total fund,5% will be for any expenses that may be incuured during the transaction ,75% will be for me and my family to invest in your country under your assistance.

But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and  since then my father took me so special. Before his death on Febuary  12th 2004 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital  and told him that he has the sum of Ten Million United State  Dollars.(USD$10 000 000) left in a security company in a mettalic trunk  box, but the security company didn't know the content because it was  registered as family valuables personal for security reasons.  I am just 21 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't  know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a  result of incessant political crisis here in LIBERIAN . The death of my  father actually brought sorrow to my life.

INVESTMENT NEGOTIATION TO THE M/D " RS ATIYA MOHAMEED  Dear.Director         It is my pleasure to write this mail to you and to say thanks for your effort in providing an opportunity to read my mail. I got your contact when i was making some searches in the internet.  My name is Mrs Atiya Mohameed, a Liberian. I was until recently the wife of Mr. Ibrahim Mohameed  who was the chief army officer to my country Libera. I am contacting you  to seek your co-operation in investing $USD10.M in your company or your country,s economy.  My  husband made this money when he was on sit as the commander and chief army officer while  Charles Taylor is the president  of Liberia.  Due to some religious and political problems , my husband was  hijacked and brutally assasainated by the rebel leathers in Liberia.  It is worthy to note that during my husband's life time he used his position as a former chief aid to must have made this money in question.  This money was realised from  the sales of gold and diamond ,which are the country's major resources and sources of income.And before his death ,my husband was able to send this money via a Ghanian diplomatic contact to the country ,where it is currently secured with a security company as a FAMILY  TREASURE   and  my name was used as the depositor in view of my husband,s position as an insider in the government.  And it was my husband,s refusal to realise the money to former President Charles Taylor that resulted in the killing in February 2003.  Now , that i have passed through the mourning ordeal for my husband  I am   thinking and planning the next step to take with respect to how  and where  to invest the money.  So my aim of sending this mail to you is to solicit your assistance in transfering this money to your country where it could be invested in a viable business for our mutual benefit. I am ready to enter into a joint venture with your company or we can open a new company with the money because i'm sure the money inside the box can establish a company of any type.  I want to assure you that you will be highly rewarded for your assistance both in cash or in the joint venture.  Please reply to this mail, indicating your ability to handle this transaction so that i will give you details to enable us map out strategies for the implementation of this project.  Best regards,  Mrs.Atiya Mohameed

In my department we discovered an abandoned Sum of $13.7M USD  (Thirteen Million, Seven Hundred Thousand US Dollars), in an account  that belongs to one of our foreign customers, an American by name: Mr.  John Schelpert who died along with his wife and other passengers in  EgyptAir Flight 990 - October 31, 1999. Since we got information about  his untimely death, the fund has been dormant in his account with my  Bank without any claim, we have been expecting his next of kin to come  over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody  applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased and the  person must be a foreigner as indicated in our banking guidelines.  Before our observation in this development, we discovered that the  owner of the account died without a Heir/WILL hence the money is  floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be  forfeited for nothing. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates  that if such money remained unclaimed after Six (6) years, the money  will be transfered into the Bank treasury account as unclaimed fund. It  is therefore upon this discovery that I and my junior colleague in the  bank now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the  money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety  and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we do not  want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. Meanwhile the whole arrangement to put claim over these fund as the  bonafide next of kin to the deceased and transfer this money to a  foreign account has been put in place. Directives and needed  information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your  interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit from this great  business opportunity. We could have done this deal on our own, but  because of our position in this country operating a local account would  eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer  because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will  require foreigner as second party that will forward claims as the next  of kin to the Bank and also present a designated safe foreign account  where he will need the money to be transferred into after due  verification and clearification by the bank. May I at this point  emphasize that this transaction is a successful arrangement, and as an  insider of the bank I have the capacity to monitor that everything is  smoothly perfected. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will  be entitled to your own share of the total sum as gratification We have  agreed that 20 % of this money will be for you as our foreign partner,  in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 5% will be set aside  for expenses incured during the business and 75% would be for me and my  colleague. There after I and my colleague will visit your country for  disbursement according to the percentages indicated. This share of  yours is negotiable as long as it is reasonable. Please, you have been  adviced to keep this information a topsecret as we are still in service  and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.  I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you  confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your  country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages we  shall agree upon. All other necessary information will be sent to you  on your acceptance to champion this transaction with us. I suggest you  get back to me as soon as possible, stating your wish in this deal.  Please do call me on my direct line for more clearifications: 00221 688  8466 Thanks and best regards. Yours faithfully, Mr. Idrissa Diop Telephone: 00221 688 8466

THIS FROM MR HENRY KABORE Dear friend.  I am Mr Henry Kabore manager audit account department of African Development Bank(A.D.B.) . In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of NINTEEN MILLION, THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($19,300,000.00 ) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in an aeroplane crash. Since the bank got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release the fund unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and laws, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. And our banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after five years, such money will be moved into the banking treasurer as unclaimed fund.  The request of a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the deceased customer was a foreigner a citizen  Burkina Faso cannot stand as next of kin. If you accept my proposal to do this deal to the end i will give to you 30% of the total money will be for you as a foreign partner while 10% will be set aside to cover any expenses that might be incurred during the process of transferring the fund to your nominated bank account.

Note: I demand the highest trust from you to keep this business strictly confidential for security reasons as you may know that the bank don't know that i am the one that contacted you to stand for this claim. At the end of this transaction which will be when the money will hit your account safely i will then come over to your country for sharing the fund according to the previous agreed percentage, you might even have to advice me on possibilities of investment in your country. I am expecting  your urgent reply so that i will send to you an  application form which you will fill and send  directly to the bank. Best regards,  Mr Henry Kabore

Mrs.Nancy Savimbi (Angola) My Dear Friend I am Mrs.Savimbi, the wife to the late Jonas Savimbi, the late leader of the national Union for The Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). My husband was killed during combat action against government forces in Mexico, Angola on the 22nd of Feb. 2002. I am contacting you because of my need to deal with person whom my family had no previous relationship.Since the death of my husband, my family has been subjected to all sorts of harassment and intimidation with lots of negative report emanating from the government of President Santosabout my husband. The present government has also ensured that all our bank accounts are frozen, and all assets sized.It is in view of this that I seek your assistance in investing and managing the sum of Seventy five Million United State Dollars in your country, being the very last of my family funds in my possession and control unknown to the government.This money now in question came as a result of Diamond Royalties that was paid to my late husband from the Diamond mining within the areas in Angola being controlled by (UNITA) for more than a decade. The money was packed in a sealed trunk box and was depositd Security/Finance Company in Spain.Right now, the present government has intensified their probe on my family's financial resources; frozen all our known foreign & local accounts, revoked Diamond licenses, and even detained my son (Charles) on alleged flimsy charges just because my husband before his death was the head of UNITA.Bearing in mind thatyour assistance is needed to transfer this money, I propose a commission of 10% (Ten Percent) of the total sum to you or your company for the expected services and assistance. Please reply me through this email address below for security reasons: nancysavimbi@myway.com I await your prompt response. Mrs.Nancy Savimbi E-mail : nancysavimbi@myway.com

Re: Very Urgent. Dear Sir,     I am sure you will be surprised at this letter that i am sending to you as we have never met before. But let me introduce myself to you. I am Mr. John Taylor, the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my Bank. In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of US$8.5M,(Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his wife and only daughter in a plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261 which crashed on 31 January, 2000. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this site http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/      The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great industrialist and a resident of Alaska.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for our bank to release the money to you. You have to follow the instruction which I will send to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill.     The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after 6 years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than 5 years and I am preparing documentaion to prove that this money has been transfered to our bank treasury. It will be between me and you only that will know that the money is not transfered into our treasure. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Senegalese cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.     In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering you 30% of the total sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other charges) likely to be incurred during the course of transaction, while the remaining 65% is for me.  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application which you will complete and forward to our bank asking for this money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thomson. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.     You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail through the above email for further directives.     Yours Faithfully,  Mr. John Taylor.

SUPPLY FROM MR KONAN ALAIN SUPPLY FROM MR KONAN ALAIN Abidjan.Cote d'Ivoire. Attn:The President Dear Sir, I write to solicite your assistance and support to enable me execute a  very  lucrative and high profiting business transaction.I am very  sure that with  trust and understanding,we will be able to execute this busines to our  mutual benefit and believe that you will not let down the  trust I am  willing to repose in you. I work for an Ivorien based import and export firm ("a-MIC"), I work product  sourcing manager. Between the 17th -19th of may, 2002 a  business seminar  was held in BOUAKE Cote Divoire  of which I attended.While in the Seminar, I  was opportuned to meet ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD ,the President of  ALI-MAHMOUD DAIRY & CATTLE FARMS ETS. ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD isan  accomplished and widely known and recognised millionaire farmer in this part  of the region. He has cattle farms in different  countries. Above all, he is  one of the greatest supplier  of cattle,beef and other diary products in  this part of the coast.On getting to know my proffesion, ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI  MAHMOUD took me into confidence by informing me about the purchase of a  particular but very  important medicine for his cattle. He informed me that  he buys this  product at $5,000.00 USD per carton, and that he mostly buys  to the excess  of 450 cartons. He informed me that he would like me to find  out if my organisation could source for him a cheaper supplier considering  the  recent trend of falls in the general price of beef in the world market   which is affecting his business. Back in my office, I discussed this proposal with my boss and he  decided to  handle the  supply by himself.We carried out a market research and   discovered that we could purchase this medicine somewhere cheaper in EUROPE  for $2,000.00 USD per carton . We moved a proposal to ALI-MAHMOUD DAIRY &  CATTLE FARMS ETS. to make the supply to them at $4,800.00 USD per carton of  which  he accepted. Owing to my role in the transaction, I had an agreement  with my  director to be receiving 15% of whatever gain is made on each  supply of which he agreed. But on the completion of the suply and the  receipt of the payment, my boss renegated on our agreement and refused to  give me my  share of the profit. Since then our relationship has been at its  lowest  ebb. I have since accepted it as one of life experiences. However, as God would have it, recently, I ran into ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI  MAHMOUD and he informed me that he would want us to urgently supply him   with 1250 cartons of the same product before the end of Dec 2006.I  used the  oppurtunity to inform Alhaji that I can  introduce him to the main producer  of this vaccine who can supply him  the product at $4,400.00 USD if he will  pay in advance as he usually  does. He was very pleased and has assured me  that he is not going to contact my boss again for this vaccine. He is  now  waiting for me to link him to the producer of the vaccine. We will buy the medicine at $2,000.00 USD from EUROPE and sell  at  $4,400.00 USD TO ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD,with him making a down  payment of  50% of our quoted price first. If you are interested and capable of handling this supplies on my  behalf,kindly get back to me urgently through my e-mail,so that we can agree  on the terms and profit sharing,after which I can then furnish you with the  contacts of both our source in EUROPE and that of ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI  MAHMOUD . Kindly be notified that at no point in time should you let  ALHAJI  NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD know that you are not the producer of the medicine and  we  should never allow him to know the contact of our real source in EUROPE  so that he would'nt bypass us to deal  directly with them. Thanks for your cooperation. Yours sincerely, MR KONAN ALAIN _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

Request for help Dear friend,  Greetings to you in the name of our heavenly God.  This mail might come to you as a surprise and the  temptation to ignore it as unserious could come into  your mind; but please, consider it a divine wish and  accept it with a deep sense of humility. My name is  simon taylor.  I,m a 65 years old man. I am British  living in Dubai (United Arab Emirate). I was a  merchant and owned two businesses in Dubai. I was  also married with two children. My wife and two  children died in a car accident six years ago.  Before this happened my business and concern for  making money was all I lived for. I never really  cared about other values in life. But since the loss  of my family, I have found a new desire to assist  helpless families. I have been helping orphans in  orphanage/ motherless homes. I have donated some  money to orphans in Sudan, South Africa, Cameroon,  Brazil, Spain, Austria, Germany and some Asian  countries. Before I became ill, I kept $5 Million  in a long-term deposit account in a finance/security  company . Presently, I,m in a  hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for  oesophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to  talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a  few months to live. It is my last wish to see this  money distributed to charity organizations. Because  relatives and friends have plundered so much of my  wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the  agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any  of them. Please, I beg you in the name of God to  help me collect the deposit and the interest accrued  from the company and distributes it  amongst charity organizations. Use your judgement to  distribute the money and feel free to reimburse yourself when you  have  the money for any cost you  incur during the process of collecting and  distributing the money to charity organizations. .  I,m willing to offer you a reward If you are willing  to help; please reply as soon as you can through my private email address simontaylor@rediffmail.com. May the  good Lord bless you and your family.  Regards,  simon taylor  simontaylor@rediffmail.com

INVESTMENT NEGOTIATION TO THE M/D " RS ATIYA MOHAMEED  Dear.Sir         It is my pleasure to write this mail to you and to say thanks for your effort in providing an opportunity to read my mail. I got your contact when i was making some searches in the internet.  My name is Mrs Atiya Mohameed, a Liberian. I was until recently the wife of Mr. Ibrahim Mohameed  who was the chief army officer to my country Libera. I am contacting you  to seek your co-operation in investing $USD10.M in your company or your country,s economy.  My  husband made this money when he was on sit as the commander and chief army officer while  Charles Taylor is the president  of Liberia.  Due to some religious and political problems , my husband was  hijacked and brutally assasainated by the rebel leathers in Liberia.  It is worthy to note that during my husband's life time he used his position as a former chief aid to must have made this money in question.  This money was realised from  the sales of gold and diamond ,which are the country's major resources and sources of income.And before his death ,my husband was able to send this money via a Ghanian diplomatic contact to the country ,where it is currently secured with a security company as a FAMILY  TREASURE   and  my name was used as the depositor in view of my husband,s position as an insider in the government.  And it was my husband,s refusal to realise the money to former President Charles Taylor that resulted in the killing in February 2003.  Now , that i have passed through the mourning ordeal for my husband  I am   thinking and planning the next step to take with respect to how  and where  to invest the money.  So my aim of sending this mail to you is to solicit your assistance in transfering this money to your country where it could be invested in a viable business for our mutual benefit. I am ready to enter into a joint venture with your company or we can open a new company with the money because i'm sure the money inside the box can establish a company of any type.  I want to assure you that you will be highly rewarded for your assistance both in cash or in the joint venture.  Please reply to this mail, indicating your ability to handle this transaction so that i will give you details to enable us map out strategies for the implementation of this project.  Best regards,  Mrs.Atiya Mohameed

FROM:ROSLIN MATHEW  FROM:ROSLIN MATHEW ABIDJAN-COTE D'IVOR FROM:ROSLIN MATHEW PLEASE MAIL BACK My Dearest ONE May the peace of gracious God be with you,please I have a problem which I  needed a help from you,I have decided to write you for help. I have a proposal for you-this however is not mandatory nor will I in any  manner compel you to honour against your will. I am in a state of delinma and made up my mind to send you this mail , I am  ROSLINE MATHEW ,21 years old and the only daughter of my late parents Mr.  and Mrs. MATHEW NZOBEl. My father was a highly reputable business magnet (a cocoa merchant) who  operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of  his bus iness trips abroad on 12th.Febuary 2004. Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been  masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time. But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and  since then my father took me so special. Before his death on February 12 2004 he called the secretary who accompanied  him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of eight million, seven  hundred thousand United State Dollars.(USD$8.700,000) left in one of the  leading security company. He further told him that he depaosited the money in my name, and finally  issued a written instruction to his lawyer whom he said is in possession of  all the necessary legal documents to this fund and the security company . I am just 21 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know  what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result o  f incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father  actually brought sorrow to my life. I am in a sincere desire of your humble  assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly  regarded. Now permit me to ask these few questions:- 1. Can you honestly help me as your daughter? 2. Can I completely trust you? 3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you  after the money is in your account? Please, Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible. Thank you so much.Mey God bless you and your family.

Friend in the Lord, Please use this money for the churches and less privileged. Greetings to you and your family in the name of God. In my search for a reliable and God fearing person and having gotten your contact through prayers and painstaking efforts I have decided to seek your help in carrying out my last wishes. My name is Mrs.Marvis Smith. I'm a 65 years old woman and from Congo. I was a merchant and owned two businesses in Dubai. I was also married with two children. My husband and two children died in a car accident six years ago. Before this happened, my business and concern for making money was all I live for. I never really cared about other values in life. But since the loss of my family, I have found a new desire to assist helpless families. I have been helping orphans in orphanage/motherless homes. I have also donated some money for humanitarian needs in Sudan, South Africa, Cameroon, Brazil, Spain, Austria, Germany and some Asian countries. Only recently I saw on television the colossal loss of properties and livelihood people in Canberra, Australia through fire. I was moving with great pity and compassion that I decided to make this contribution on assisting people over there, I kept $US25,000,000.00 Million in a long-term deposit account in a Finance company. Presently, I'm in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for oesophagi cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only few months to live. It is my last wish to see this money distributed to victims of the fire outbreak in Australia and other charity organization. Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them. Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me collect the deposit and  distributes it accordingly. Use your judgment to distribute the money and keep 20% of it to yourself. Feel free to reimburse yourself when you have the money for any cost you incur during the process of collecting and distributing the money. If you are willing to help, please reply as soon as possible. May the good lord bless you and your family. Please, send reply and all correspondences to my attorney : Barrister.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because it cannot be released unless somebody  applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately , all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind  for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you via your foreign bank account as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and  subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and this money Could go into the  Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money Remained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transferred into the  Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request for your assistance and maximum co-operation as a foreign citizen to stand as the next of kin in this  business is occasioned by the fact that the deceased customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. 40 % of this money will be for you as my foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account. 10 %will be set aside for expenses in cured  during the business and 50 % would be for me. There after I will come over to your  country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.

INVESTMENT NEGOTIATION TO THE M/D " RS ATIYA MOHAMEED  Dear Sir,         It is my pleasure to write this mail to you and to say thanks for your effort in providing an opportunity to read my mail. I got your contact when i was making some searches in the internet.  My name is Mrs Atiya Mohameed, a Liberian. I was until recently the wife of Mr. Ibrahim Mohameed  who was the chief army officer to my country Libera. I am contacting you  to seek your co-operation in investing $USD10.M in your company or your country,s economy.  My  husband made this money when he was on sit as the commander and chief army officer while  Charles Taylor is the president  of Liberia.  Due to some religious and political problems , my husband was  hijacked and brutally assasainated by the rebel leathers in Liberia.  It is worthy to note that during my husband's life time he used his position as a former chief aid to must have made this money in question.  This money was realised from  the sales of gold and diamond ,which are the country's major resources and sources of income.And before his death ,my husband was able to send this money via a Ghanian diplomatic contact to the country ,where it is currently secured with a security company as a FAMILY  TREASURE   and  my name was used as the depositor in view of my husband,s position as an insider in the government.

Re:  How are you doing? St.Thomas' Hospital, Lambeth Palace Road London SE1 7EH United-Kingdom. Tel: 447035900075.                    Dear Friend In Christ, I believe you will treat this mail with the fear of God. It is with tears that I am writing you this mail; I don`t need your pity, but love to my son. My mail may seem very painful and sorrowful, but there is more you can do in my request than to pity me, which is to show LOVE to my son. I was an orphan and do not wish my son to experience what i have been through on Earth after an automobile crash that nearly claimed my life. My name is Edward Brown, married to the late Juan J.Brown, who died with our two daughters in Indonesia on 26th of December 2004 during the Tsunami Disaster, after this Painful and sorrowful incident, my condition worsened and I was diagnosed of cancer, which got worst and I have been suffering from heart failure and hepatitis since. My friends ignored me due to my relationship with God on sickbed. My wife, our children and I have been in United Kingdom for a long time. We all were suppose to travel to Indonesia in December 2004, but my bad health, did not permit me to travel with them, which made me and my son stay behind while my wife and our two daughters traveled. If not, all of us would have perished in the disaster. My reason of writing you this mail is due to the sad news that came to me recently from the doctors. After my last diagnosed result, it was proved by the doctors that i may not leave for more than one month ahead, due to the damage the cancer have caused in my system unless I undergo an urgent surgical operation which my chance of survival is less than 10% according to the medical experts. As it stands, I have given to fate and have found God on sick bed. But i have a more concern problem, which is why I have contacted you. Please, this is about my son. Since it is now obvious that i will die, my son's future has been the greatest problem i have. I want you to take care of my son please. He is only 13years and we have no person here to take care of him if I die today. My friends for knowing God deserted me. I left some money in a deposit house at United Kingdom, which i intended to use for investment in Indonesia. I want you to take this money and my son. Use the money into a big investment, that you will manage until my son grows up to take over the investment. I will like you to take my son as your own son, give him the love we the parents would have given him. Do not let him feel the pains of being an orphan, give him good education, bring him up into a responsible man. Make him have the fear of God. Please do not refuse this task. I have no one else to help me out on this issue, I am an orphan who grew up without knowing God rather focused on wealth and otherwise, living a life of fantasy and doesn't care or know who God is. Do not pity me, rather take good care of and bring him up to be God fearing. As soon as I receive your reply including your personal details, all i will do is to authorize my bank to transfer the money to your account directly and i will also draw up my will in your favor. I will give the bank all the documents that is covering the deposit with the bank, i will transfer every power and right of ownership to you stating at my Will to enable you claim the deposit from the bank. It will be also included in the Will that you are the only person my son should be released to, if i die. All i need is your acceptance and assurance that you will not treat my son badly. I am writing you this mail with great tears and i pray you will be kind & honest with fear of God concerning this mail to you today. Please reply this mail immediately if you have the love and care of God at: help.ed_brown@yahoo.co.uk Thank you. Mr. Edward Brown +447045700928.

Urgent (Please Reply) Dear Friend I am Barrister  Jack Vanrenos, the personal Attorney to Mr. Charles Jones a foreigner who used to work with BMW Rockingham here in England. On the 2nd of August 2003, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along Gatwick Express Road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries to your Embassy to locate any of my client’s extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet, to locate any member of his family but of no avail, hence I contacted you. I have contacted you to assist me in repatriating the money left behind by my client before they got confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Finance House where these huge deposits were lodged. Particularly, the Finance House where the deceased had an account valued at about US$20.7M has issued me a notice to provide the next-of-kin or have the account confiscated within the next Forteen official working days. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over nine (9) months now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$20.7M can be paid to you and then you and I can share the money 60% to me and 35% to you, while 5% should be for expenses or tax as your government may required. I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make, all I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Await your prompt response in my private email address <jkvan@mail.com>  for better communication.

I am Mr. Jackson khumalo, the Director of Delivery/Operations in a security company here in South Africa. Our firm is a security company of high repute with years of outstanding service to the people of Africa especially top government officials and military leaders in the world. I have resolved to contact you through this medium based on  Business proposal that will be of mutual benefit to both of us. I have not discussed this transaction with anybody because it is of top secret. To be explicit and straight to the point, a reputable client of ours deposited a consignment in our company's  Vault for safekeeping. And since then our client has failed to come forward to claim his consignment, which has accumulated a considerable amount of money in demurrage.  Consequently, in our bide to contact this client to redeem the demurrage which his  Consignment had accumulated I discovered that our client was the former Late Prime Minister of Lebanon, Mr. Rafik Hariri,                      PROFILE of the Late Minister of Lebanon: Rafik Bahaa Edine Hariri {November 1, 1944 � February 14, 2005} married to Nazek Audi  Hariri, was a Lebanese self � made billionaire and business tycoon, and was former  Prime Minister of Lebanon {1992 � 1998 and 2000 � 2004} before his late resignation from office on October 20, 2004. The late Rafik Hariri died on February 14, 2005 when explosives equivalent to around 300 kg of C4 were detonated as his motorcade drove past the Saint George Hotel in the Lebanese capital, for more information please log on to {http://www.hariri.info}. After in the same year the consignment was entrusted into our care. Since the death of  our client Late Prime Minister of Lebanon,Mr. Rafik Hariri,none of his benefactors has  come forward to claim the consignment with us, which means that non of his relatives or  Aids had any knowledge of this consignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided to secretly open the box that our client deposited in our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the metal box that were registered as treasures by our client actually  contained a considerable amount of money in United States Dollars amounting to about US$25Million US Dollar. Since this development I have been nursing plans secretly. I also found out from enquiries and the foreign media that our late client siphoned a lot of money from his country while he was in office as Prime Minister, It is my conviction that the consignment in our vault was part of the money that our client siphoned and now that he is dead there is no trace to this money in our care. After going through his (WILL) I  Found that he stated that the treasure should be used to support (Islamic race). Finally, I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist me in transferring this money out of South Africa to your country for immediate investment. I have also decided that you will generously be entitled to 40% of the total amount. Upon my receipt of your reply confirming your willingness to assist me of this transaction, I  Will immediately arrange and transfer all the rights of ownership of this consignment to your name to facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of the complete funds to your country for onwards investment. This transaction is 100% risk free. Please maintain absolute confidentiality on this matter. Please reply on my private mail (jackkhumalo@sify.com) I await your most prompt response.

This sum of $35,520,000 USD (Thirty Five Million, Five Hundred and Twenty  Thousand United States Dollar) is still  in my possession in my Bank  lifeless and unnoticed because there will never be a claim on the funds  and all material and immaterial documents and certificates relating to the  funds is also in my possession.  According to the Hong Kong Law regulating cases of this nature which is  also typical to other Asian countries, at the expiration of 5 (five)  years, such funds will revert to the ownership of the Government for  financing military operations, such as purchasing of arms and ammunitions  for the military.  In order to avert this negative development, I will like to seek for your  permission as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Mathew  Schneider so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not be use for  financing weapons which will further enhance the courses of war in the  world in general.

I am writing from Europe, where I moved immediately after his death due to the violence and uncertainties back home as a result of the war and the purpose of my mail is to request for your assistance in a financial transaction.     Before the death of my father, he deposited the sum of (US$12.5M)in a private Security Deposit Firm in Europe and this money was initially meant for the purchase of new construction machines.      I am seeking your assistance in transferring this money into a private or company account for investment purposes. I want to assure you that this fund is safe for investment.     If you can be of assistance in this regard, kindly get back to me so we can discuss further.      Thanking you in anticipation of your cooperation.   Best Regards,   Joan Ahmed 
FROM  MR . RAHA. ALI , WAITING TO READ FROM YOU SOONEST FROM THE DESK OF:MR . RAHA. ALI dIRECTOR AUDIT AND ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT, BANK OF AFRICA, OUAGA-BURKINA-FASO. ATTN: Please. Greetings to you, I am Mr.Raha.Ali. the Account Manager of Late Mr.Morris  Thompson in Bank of Africa, here in Burkina Faso.However I got your contact  through the International web directory.I decided to contact you by email  because I feel that it is more secured and private. Recently i discovered a Dormant Account with a huge amount of Money Valued  USD14,000,000.00 (Fourteen Million Dollars only)that belongs to one of our  late Customer who died in a plane crash. During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came  across a very huge sum of money belonging to Late Mr. Morris Thompson an  American great industrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately  lost his life in the plane  crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000,including his wife and only daughter. You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got during my  investigation;http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/ andttp://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html The fund has been dormant in his account With this Bank without any claim of  the funds in our custody either from his family or relation before our  discovery of this development. The Banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for Six  years, it will be forfeited to the Bank treasury as an unclaimed bill.It is  only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and It is upon this  discovery that I decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out this dormant fund. In order to avert this negative development, I on behalf of my trusted  colleagues now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to  Our late Customer so that the fund will be released and paid into your  account as the beneficiary´s next of kin now that the bank is still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased ,Late Mr. Morris  Thompson. In fact we could have done this deal alone but because of our position in  this country as civil servants, we are not allowed to operate a foreign  account and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the  time of transfer since I still work in this bank, this is the actual reason why I required a second party or fellow who will assist me forward  claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account  or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this fund, even an empty  a/c can also serve for this purpose. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% as  gratification for your assisting me, and the remaining 60% will be for me. What I want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin. I have  in my possession, all the necessary informations to successfully accomplish  this operation. Bear in mind that this proposal is 100% risk free. Further Information will be given to you as soon as I receive your positive  response. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your interest to enable us proceed. I await your Urgent Response Regrads, MR .RAHA.

Re: Your Kind Attention Needed Re: Your Kind Attention Needed  Dear Friend,  My name is Mr. Chris Swales and I work with a Bank here in    London-England, The name of the bank is Barclays Bank. We had a    Mr.Allen Duke, customer that had a deposit of US$4.8M (Four Million    Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) before he died in a    plane crash with his wife and only Child about 6years now (January 30,    2000) and since he died, we in the Bank here have been expecting    his/her next of kin/relative(s) for the inheritance of the deposit,    but none has surfaced.  The policy of the Bank however stipulates a limited time period for    such inheritance to be made or the fund will be written off going by    the record of the incident, the time limit for the claim is closing    up. In this consideration, I am contacting you to seek for your kind    understanding and sincere co-operation to claim this inheritance for    our mutual benefit.  If you can stand as the next of kin in this project, success is    assured because I am in possession of the personal file jacket of the    deceased which contains every needed information about the account and    the deceased. You and I stand no risk of any kind because I have    enough information to support you in claiming the inheritance.  The proceedings of the transaction will be shared 50% each after    expenses are reimbursed. Kindly indicate your willingness by email on    chriswales@katamail.com and we shall proceed with the initial step for    the claim. The entire project is expected to last for about ten    working days.  Please kindly get back to me urgently so that we will discuss more on    this issue. Also do not fail to furnish me with your direct phone and    fax numbers for easier communication.  Best Regards,  Chris Swales  Email:chriswales@katamail.com

BUSINESS URGENT!!! Compliments. Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is not a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it serious. We want to transfer to an oversea account ($16,700.000.00 USD) Sixteen Million Seven Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) from one of the banks located in Dakar Senegal. I want to ask you, If you are not capable to quietly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business ,I am trusting in you and believing in God that you will never let me down either now or in future.  I am Mr Philip Tarila. a personal assiatant to late Andreas Schranner. During the course of his bank's last week auditing,it was discovered that since his death no one has come forward to lay claim to this funds.So  the bank issued me a memo to provide his next of kin or forfeith the funds. This account was opened with the bank in 1999 and since 2000 nobody has operated on this account again, after going through some old files in my records,I discovered that my late client  died without a [Heir/WILL] hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.  The owner of this account Mr. Andreas Schranner a German property magnate who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of AF4590 German Concorde which crahsed on July 25th 2000,including his family leaving nobody as next of kin.  No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that the account is a secret account. The total amount involved is Sixteen million Seven Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only [$16, 700.000.00] and we wish to transfer this money into a safe foreigners account abroad. But I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here, but to a foreigner who has information about the account, which I shall give to you upon your positive response. I am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business, you are the first and the only person that I am contacting for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take urgently.  At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 25% of the total amount,70% will be for us, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring. I look forward to your earliest reply. PLEASE, TREAT THIS PROPOSAL AS TOP  SECRET.reply to (philip_tarila01@myway.com) Best Regards, Mr.Philip Tarila.

THE FUND HAS BEEN DORMANT IN HIS ACCOUNT WITH THE BANK WITHOUT ANY CLAIM OF THE FUND IN OUR CUSTODY EITHER FROM HIS FAMILY OR RELATION BEFORE OUR DISCOVERY TO THIS DEVELOPMENT.ALTHOUGH PERSONALLY, I KEPT THIS INFORMATION SECRET WITHIN MYSELF TOENABLE THE WHOLE PLANS AND IDEA BE PROFITABLE AND SUCCESSFUL DURING THE TIME OF EXECUTION, THE AMOUNT INVOLVED IS USD$10.000,000, MEANWHILE THE WHOLE ARRANGEMENT AND DIRECTIVES NEEDED TO PUT CLAIM OVER THIS FUND AS THE NEXT OF KIN TO THE DECEASED, WILL BE FORWARD TO YOU UPON YOUR ACCEPTANCE INFORMATION WILL BE RELAYED TO YOU AS SOON AS YOU INDICATE YOUR INTEREST AND WILLINGNESS TO ASSIST US AND ALSO BENEFIT YOUR SELF TO THIS GREAT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.

CONFIDENTIAL DEAL,PLEASE GET BACK TO ME Dear Friend,  I am captain James .W. Brian in the US Marine Corps on Monitoring and Peace a  keeping mission in Baghdad-Iraq. The reason why I am explaining  my finding  to you is to seek for your assistance to enable you contributes  immensely to the actualization of my dreams.  On the 18th day of March 2007, we were alerted on the presence of some  terrorists hideouts in Haifa Street, a long thoroughfare of high-rise  buildings built by Saddam Hussein here in Baghdad.  After Immediate intervention by the Iraqi forces and ours, we were able  to  capture many foreign Arab fighters linked to al Qaeda in that operation and  over 100 militants were killed on the process. Among the  Arab fighters  linked to al Qaeda two were interrogated by two of our  intelligent  investigators and I. They confessed that some of them are  fighters for al  Qaeda and some are for Ayman al-Zawahiri and they took us to  some of their  hideout which runs along the west bank of the Tigris River  that cuts through  the capital.  When we invaded into the hideout, we recovered several guns, amour including  some boxes among which two contains bullets, one filled with  hard  drugs  (heroine) and the other two to my amazement contain some US Dollars  which we assumed amounted to $23.2M after I and two of the  intelligent  investigators counted them and it took us over 4 hours to get  it counted.  I however instructed them to keep this in high secrecy so that we can have  the money to our selves, they all agreed to the plan and they  replied to me  on how I can get this huge sum out of this country and I  told them that  ital&#8482;s no problem.  This motivated me to connive with my best friend in our force who went with  me and the two other officers to keep the boxes in a safer place.  I am now in keen need of a "Reliable and Trustworthy" person like you who  would receive, secure and protect these boxes containing the US Dollars for  me  untill my assignment elapses here.  I assure and promise to give you 20% of this fund, however feel free to  negotiate what you wish to have as your percentage in this deal.  Please assure me of your keeping this topmost secret to protect my job with  the US Monitoring and Peace-Keeping mission. please you can  contact me with  my private mailbox......  capt.james_brianusmarine5@yahoo.com  My Sincere regards,  Capt James Brian.(U.S MARINE)

I am about to tell you something that I have not discuss with anyone excluding my lawyer. My father was a big time farmer in south Africa, he uses most of South Africa land for farming. The Government in South Africa gave him those lands for farming and he will pay back when he have the money, it was like a loan they gave him the lands as loan My father was very successful In the farming business and he paid all the Government back. Some top officials In the Government were Jealous because of his wealth. They wanted him to Join them carry out a dubious deal against the Government but he refuse ,so they plan to kill him and claim all his wealth he has suffered for, in South Africa. On his way home one day he was coming from the office and he was assassinated and he was rushed to the hospital by a good Samaritan. But he did not survive It .But before they killed him he saw It coming and transfer most of his fund to a Security company In Holland. He died In the hospital ,But before he died he gave me the contact Information to the Security company which the fund was located. Those people were looking for me and my family and we ran to Nigeria for safety because they know we know were my father funds were hidden. I contacted the Security company yesterday on how I could collect the funds with my lawyer assistance and they told me that I need a foreign beneficiary outside Africa because of Security reasons. And I don�t have anyone outside Africa that will stand for me as a beneficiary.  They said the money was too big (TWENTY MILLION USDOLLARS)My father never  told me the amount of the money I was so shock. They also said that the funds has been deposited there for about four years  now and it has accumulated demurrage which we must pay before the consignment will be released.

I NEED YOUR URGENT REPLY  CONFIDENTIAL PLEASE FROM THE DESK OF DR.ADAMU ALI, AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING MANEGER, BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) OUAGADOUGOU-BURKINA FASO. Dear Friend, I am the manager of auditing and accounting at the foreign remittance  department of BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) here in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. In  my department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$15m dollars (Fifteen   Million US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign  customer (MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany) who died along with  his entire family in Jully 2000 in a plane crash.For more informations about  the crash you can visit this site:  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that  all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the  plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is  coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as  unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed after seven  years, the money will be transfered into the bank  treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this  business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a  Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision  of a foriegn account ,10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the  business and 60% would be for me Thereafter, I will visit your country for  disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to enable the  immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply first to the  bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of application  that i will send to you,so i will like you to send to me your private  telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location  where in the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of  the application . I will not fail to bring to your notice this transaction  is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all  required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. Yours Faithfully, 1. NAME IN FULL:................................ 2.

please read and get back to me Beloved,  I am sorry for my unannounced communication with you especially through this common method but I promise to give you more reasons for this in due course.  I am Nopparat Sujaritpinij from Thailand (nopparat.sujaritpinij@worker.com). I worked with Terry Ford 51, a white farmer in Zimbabwe till his sudden death in March, 2002. My boss, Terry Ford was a rich commercial and successful farmer in Zimbabwe till the land reforms of Mugabe led government which exposed many white farmers to the brutality of the black "war veterans" who in one of their attacks shot and killed him.  In case you are not familiar with this incident, you can look it up in any international news media like; http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1878846.stm , http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2002/03/18/zimbabwe020318.html.  Well, I am contacting you in respect of a deposited fund which is to the tone of us$16 million which was meant for the purchase of farm tools and accessories. Since his death, I have thought of a way forward but with the continuous stay of the funds with bank, the government may trace it which means a total lost hence I arranged for the withdrawal.  I successfully withdrew the funds and re-deposited it with a private security company as a family treasure. As it is, I am well informed about farming and could do any other business as well but all I need now is a partner to help me in settling down this funds in any account(s) be it personal or company's account.  Please, is rest assured that it is between me and you and so shall I like it to remain. Again, the funds in question as it is has nothing whatsoever to do with Zimbabwe any longer as I urge you to feel free in dealing with me as no risk is involved.  In dealing with you, I am ready to compensate your efforts with 17% of the total funds while 3% will be to reimburse any form of expenses from your side otherwise, we can work on partnership in all investments.  I will wait to hear from you as I will be ever ready to supply you with every details of myself as well as that of the transaction.  Regards,  Nopparat Sujaritpinij  nopparat.sujaritpinij@worker.com

 Good day to you. Please your reply expected. Content-Type: text/plain Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit Date: Thu, 28 Jun 2007 00:15:45 +0200 (CEST) Hello, Good day to you. First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction and IRRESPECTIVE of other mails you may have received, please I urge you to treat this one with utmost CONFIDENCE. This is by virtue of its nature CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. Though know that the transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. I am Mr. FREDERICK WILLIAMS I am sorry if I have intruded on your privacy or barged in on you without your permission. I have a very rewarding project, which I think will be beneficial to both of us putting trust, confidentiality and most of all the fear of God into focus. If after going through this email you do not find it interesting please disregard it and send me a formal response. I was a member of the Abuja National stadium building and organizing Committee of the just concluded "ALL AFRICAN GAMES" which was organized and hosted by Nigeria but before now I have been a director of sports in the Federal Ministry of Sports and Youth Development. We were appointed over 3 years ago to supervise the building of the ultra modern Abuja National Stadium, putting in place all equipments needed for the completion of the stadium which is acclaimed to be one of the best in the world today and also involved in the planning and hosting of the games. This project cost the government of Nigeria Millions of dollars. The stadium project has been completed; all equipments put in place and Commissioned and used for the All African Games tagged "ABUJA 2003". The accounts have been rendered to the government satisfactorily and we have received commendations for a job well done. During the construction, planning and execution of this project, as the Chairman of contract award committee I was able to make some money for myself through contract that was awarded to Dewolfgang Gmbh, which I over-invoiced to the tune of USD18.5M with the help of Dewolfgang Gmbh the original contractor. All I want you to do is to assist me in clearing this amount while standing in as the owner and director of Vacknol Nigeria International Limited in whose name I made as the beneficiary of the funds. Vacknol Nigeria International Limited is an international company and could have a company anywhere in the world the most important thing been that it is registered here in Nigeria as a limited liability company in line with the company and allied matters decree of Nigeria which I have since done, I have also in my possession some contract document which will act as proof that Vacknol Nigeria International Limited executed the contract as a sub contractor under the Dewolfgang Gmbh who is the major contractor that executed the contract that was over -invoiced. On the payment of this money to you as the supplier in the name of Vacknol Nigeria International limited because I will apply for the transfer in this name, and you as the director of the company. I will come to meet with you so that we can both sit down and discuss further, what kind of business we will enter into or if need be expand your already existing business, but actually I hope to establish a five star hotel and go into real estate development as these are life time businesses that I know are of high yields interest any where in the world. I know you will be entitled to some percentage of this money as Compensation for your efforts, please feel free to indicate what you will take from this amount, as this is very important to me before we commence proceedings. I will tell you more about this when I hear from you. I will give you every detail of what we are to do. I want to assure you my dear friend that with your cooperation and understanding the sky will be our limit.  Please do contact me immediately. Best regards, Frederick Williams.

During our investigation and auditing in this Bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to one of our deceased customer who died on Feb 29th 2002 of a ghastly motor accident and the fund has been dormant in his account with this bank without any claim of the fund in our Custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this  development.

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free, on smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer, while 65% will be for  me, please you have been advised to keep "Top Secret" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.

For your kind attention For your kind attention Good-day, you may be surprised to receive this letter from me, but it is a matter that I am convinced we can solve both, if we work together in harmony. However, I seek for your absolute confidence as I introduce myself to you. My name is AHMED HASSAN, Assistant Auditor OFFSHORE FINANCE HOME, DUBAI U.A.E. In the discharge of my duty as the Assistant Auditor, I stumbled on this domiciliary account that has remained dormant for three years now with Ten million six hundred US dollars (US$10.6m) in it. I contacted my directors and we sent out staff for enquiries about this fund and discovered that the account holder died in an accident. I am writing you so that we can work together to remit the money to you as the next of kin because this money belongs to a foreigner and has to be claimed by a foreigner. I guarantee this transaction under legitimate arrangements that will not bridge the law by both parties. I have options to offer you, first you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for your assistance, or you can go into partnership for a proper profitable investment of the money. Which ever option you choose, feel free to notify me. If for some reasons you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you 25% of the money. Note, on the event that you cannot assist me to do the business, I beg you to still keep my contact and existence of this fund a secret. I also require you make available to me your confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me communicate with you easily. It is simple process which will take a short while to process. To indicate your interest to work with us, I will give you more detailed information regarding on what to do and how to do it for us to achieve good success about the transaction as soon as I hear from you. Please reply to my private email address: akabir1696@hotmail.com Best Regards, Dr. Ahmed Hassan

I AM WAITING TO RECEIVE YOUR MAIL‎ From: Mr LAAD COLOGO Manager,Audit/Account Section African Development Bank Ouagadougou Burkina-Faso      Dear FRIEND,   How are you today? Hope all is well. Please be informed that I have decided to contact you for a fund transfer transaction worth the sum of US$22,300,000.00 into your reliable bank account as the sole NEXT-OF-KIN to the foreign deceased customer of our bank (an International Billionaire French Businessman) who was killed with his entire family by PLANE-CRASH in Central England atmost 3 years ago. Since his death occured, no body have show up as his next of kin for the claim because the account is untraceable. Upon the investigation I carried out from his records, I found out that his foreign business consultant who would have trace the account died earlier before the deceased. Therefore, this is a confidential and sealed deal. For the success of this transaction, you should apply and act as the only existing NEXT-OF-KIN to the deceased which our bank will replace the deceased account information through proper documentation in position of your own account. This transaction is risk-free, it will never harm your good reputation in your society because no one can trace the account, and on the instant of the transfer of the fund into your account, the chapter of this transaction will be closed entirely. Note that in a business of this nature, the bank dont want to know your difference between the deceased country, religion or believe because our bank inheritance law is against that. So, it is a preference for us achieve this success without any problem. Please note down that once the fund get transferred into your account, you will take 39% of the total sum while the rest will be for me as I will arrange myself down to your count ry to take my share. I need your urgent response and include your private telephone/mobile numbers for easy communication.Please reply if you can be trusted in this deal. Thanks,  Mr.LAAD COLOGO.

CASTLE LAW CHAMBERS (urgent reply, can i trust you?)   CASTLE CHAMBERS LEGAL SOLICITORS/PRIVATE LAWYERS LONDON HA1 3LP UNITED KINGDOM. Direct Telephone; +44-703-189-3319 Direct Fax; +44-700-594-2286  Good Day Dear, My name is JONATHAN WRIGHT, Principal Partner in CASTLE Law Chambers,  London,UK. I was formally a personal attorney to Mr. Mohammed Saibi who  was the chairman of Algosaibi Diving and marine Services in Dhahran,  Saudi Arabia. Mr. Saibi died late last year of heart attack at the ripe  age of 79 years. Mr. Mohammed Saibi a Saudi Arabia Philanthropist, before he died, made  a Will in my law firm stating that $3.2M (Three million, Two Hundred  Thousand U.S. dollars only) should be donated to any charity home of our  choice overseas as his last contribution to humanity when it became  obvious that he will not stay alive for too long. His only son, Rasheed  Saibi and his entire family has no knowledge of this. However, I am very much aware that he has left enough wealth that will  last his generation a lifetime. The true situation at the moment is  that the said amount of money was deposited with the BANK here in UK only  to be paid out to a charity home.The charity home/organization would  have to be picked by my law office. This implies that you will stand as  the beneficiary to this Will so that the funds could be processed and  transferred to your account if you are ready and in a position to assist  me. You do not need to have a charity organization, all you need do is  to declare your interest and show seriousness. As a professional lawyer, I have mapped out strategies which I will use  to obtain all the proper/legal documentations and last approval from  Ministry of Finance concerning the funds which I will send the copies  across to you for your perusal and record puppose before the bank will  contact you. I am particularly interested in securing this money from the Bank  because they have issued a notice instructing us to produce the beneficiary  of this Will as soon as possible, else the account would be made  dormant since Mr. Saibi was ill for a long period of time before his  demise.If you are interested in assisting me, I will give you 30% of the entire  funds after paying taxes due to your government and expenses incurred  during the course of this transaction. The balance will be mine  although I intend to send some of it to a charity organization. I urge you to contact me immediately for further details if you are  satisfied with my proposition and feel you are in a position to assist me.  Bearing in mind the confidential nature of this transaction. For the trust I have on you, I believe that you have the ability to  handle this transaction, I will Prefer you respond through this particular  mail or call me on my direct phone indicated above. Yours faithfully, BARR.JONATHAN WRIGHT Esq. FOR:CASTLE LAW CHAMBERS.

From Dr Usman Ibrahim / Mr Wahid Yoffe property. FROM DR USMAN IBRAHIM DANKO. AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT. FOREIGN OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT. BANQUE TOGOLAISE POUR LE COMMERCE ET L'INDUSTRIE, LOME- TOGO.  Dear Friend,             I do not intend to cause any grief to you. The reason for sending this mail is very fundamental to the doctrine of human privileges and right. My name is Dr Usman Ibrahim Danko  I am quite convicned of the fact that this will come to you as a surprise.however I am writing based on the privlage information I garthered about you in internet during my extensive search for a repose foreign partner who is compitent of assisting me in below business proposal. I am the principal manager controlling the auditing and accounting section of Banque Togolaise Pour Le Commerce Et L'Inustrie Lome Togo. in West Africa with due respect and regard.  I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person Mr Wahid Yoffe who died in the horrific Asian tsunamis of Dec. 26, 2004, that has killed more than all 20th- century tsunamis combined that happened in Sumatra island, Indonesia.  From the information that our bank have gotten so far, the Tsunami killed him with his entire family and no none relation have been identified. The person that he used as his next of kin was his first son of 25 years old who died along side with the entire family. Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself and partner to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amount was (US$11.4M).  Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity that comes once in life. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant, we are not allowed to perate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank.  This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also resent a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred in to on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.  May I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as I have made arrangements for a successful deal before contacting you. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer processing and also telephone bills, while 65% will be for me and my partner.  Please, you have been adviced to keep top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in.  All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this deal. Yours Sincerely,  Dr Usman Ibrahim Danko.
