====================
FROM:  Dear Sir/Madam,  I am Dr. Ahmed Yousef the Auditor General of Bank of  Africa (B.O.A).I have a very important and  Confidential Business proposition for you. Our mutual business  proposal was first discussed at the recent BANK OF  AFRICA Annual Conference and Dim Sum Conference in  Accra, Ghana. During the recent accounting change in Africa with the  introduction of the new whoidining tax on gold and other valuable  assets, I was able to negotiate the above statutory  sales tax with my Bank and we have agreed to offset the  actual amount of $60.5 million that we incured in encumbered  account with our own Mutual Assistance. This amount  was duly paid into your account through our Bank Manager  here in Accra, Ghana and now we plan to move  to your country to secure our future Investment if  you are  willing to assist us.  I have already made my proposal to you and it is  being  officially processed and carefully considered by our bank management  before I accept your call as the next of kin to the  funds.  With the recent introduction of the whoidining tax in Africa and the  subsequent devaluation of our shares in major banks in  Europe, the present whoidining of these funds into  your account is like buying a used car. The first mile you  make in your account at our bank is like buying a million  carat of diamond from the locales of which you are a dealer,  the whodunit of the funds will be 30% of the $60 million, 5% will be  set aside for miscellaneous expenses and 70% will be for me.  I have all the necessary legal documents to back  up my claim and the claim will be approved to your account.  I am ready to pay the whodunit of the funds as soon as you indicate  your interest and willingness to assist us. On the other hand, the  miscellaneous expenses incurred by us during the course of this  transaction would be paid into your account as expenses in  subsequent transactions.  All I require is your strict trust and confidentiality to  enable us see this transaction through. If this proposal is  acceptable by you, please do not make undue advantage of the trust  reposed on you and do not entertain any fear of encountering  this problem myself or my son  in the future transaction as all related

FROM my late husband.  I am a citizen of the Republic of South Africa and a member of a Specialized Group on African Development Implementation Group that was recently inaugurated by the President of South Africa Mr Robert G. Sandstal to deal with the South African Government procurement issues.  In 2001, my late husband was the Director General Contract Audit Office of the South African Ministry of Mining and Resources.  In 2003, he was appointed Director General Contract Audit Office of the Ministry of Mining and Resources.  Unfortunately, he was murdered by the rebelles led by Mr. Joseph Kony in our city, which resulted to the killing of my husband's close friend and business associate, Joseph Nkomo, by the combined forces of Mr. Sandstal and his followers.  I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the interrogators, my husband has been shot to death with a machine gun and my late husband's personal effects were also seized by the interrogators.  I am now in a refugee camp in Dakar-Senegal, in the Republic of Togo, where I have been receiving my Education.  I have since written several times to the Security Company here in Senegal seeking for a foreign assistance, but to no avail.  I have also been threatened to abandon my children because of my present for alleged involvement in this transaction.  I have kept this information current and have kept it hidden to no avail.  I then directed that if they do not accept my offer they will kill me.  I am presently staying in Senegal dakar the capital of Senegal dakar .  I have also been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the interrogating the staff of the Company while I was out on bail.  I have since written to the Security Company seeking for my refugee status. I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is risk free.  I have contacted you independently of our differences because I have gone into a state of shock and rest assured that I would not be anywhere to be seen. I therefore highly need your utmost confidentiality and trust while I continue my research and my husband's business are highly valued. Please do not hesitate to contact me upon your  acceptance of my proposal.  Please you can also contact me through my private email address:  mr_mulumba@caramail.com.  Thanks and God bless.

Dear Sir/Madam,  I am Mr.Andreas von Schranner, a native of Germany and a business consultant to the late Federal Minister of Minerals and Energy Engr.Wolfgang Schranner.

I have made all the necessary inquiries to determine the next of kin and the only person that can assist us to claim this customer's funds. The beneficiary of this funds is Mr.Wolfgang Schranner, the son of the late Federal Minister of Minerals and Energy Engr.Wolfgang Schranner. The funds was deposited with the Security Company in Amsterdam, Netherlands in a dormant account that it cannot be operated overdue.  The contract period for which this customer was paid by our bank was concluded in 2001. The contract period for which a new contract has been completed with the same contractor has been duly completed and the contract work is due to be completed in early 2003. In line with our internal department code of conduct, we discovered a dormant account in our branch that belongs to this late Federal Minister and he has been declared not a beneficiary to the funds because he did not declare any next of kin to the account.  We are now seeking a legal person to claim the funds and proceed as the next of kin to the late Federal Minister so that we can start work on the project.

Dear Sir,  I know that this proposal might be a surprise to you but do consider it as an emergency. In a nut shell, My name is Miss Vivian Nkono the daughter of late chief Dr. Phil Nkono of the Democratic Republic of Congo. My father was a very wealthy farmer and a prominent politician in my country.  Before the death of my father, he had given me the certificate of deposite he used to deposit the sum of US$30.5 million (Thirty Million Five Hundred United States Dollars) in one of the private security companies in Europe, as family valuables, when he realized the looming danger in my country.  This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in Switerland and African countries.  Unfortunately, my father was killed during the land dispute in my country. Since then, we have been subjected to inhuman physical and psychological torture by our government, our family's  lawyer and my mother's associate, who is now a private attorney representing my family, who are presently under house arrest.  My father was very wealthy and after his death, I inherited all his business and wealth, as all his business  associate have been detained and has their accounts frozen by the Nigerian court for allegedly plotting to eliminate my government.  My father deposited the sum of US$30.5 million (Thirty Million Five Hundred United States Dollars) with a private security company in Europe. This money was kept in a metal box for safe keeping. I and my mother have decided to move out of the country as orphans and I am presently living as a political asylum. My father's name is Nkono Nkono the son of late chief. Nkono is the son of late chief Joseph Nkono of the Democratic Republic of Congo. My father was a very wealthy farmer and a prominent politician in my country.

Though I am very rich  in a variety of sciences and  art forms, I was never  open handed  about my hobbies, my favourite  ones being photography and writing.  I am really  sorry to touch you without moreso information  about this  cancerous condition.  I have  decided to contact you as a  business person to help us  establish a good business  relationship  with you, we should first  establish a phone  and  fax line to communicate with you.

Since we have not met before, I decided to contact you to assist him in transferring the fund to his country, so that he can start up a new business with my share of the total sum. As a civil servant, I have the utmost confidence and regard in your capability and ability to handle this project. I am writing you this letter because of the information I gathered from the Bank's information exchange. I want to let you know that the bank has no record of any transaction with me in the past, neither the claim for the fund. I have contacted you independently of our work to contact foreign investors for the fund to be used wisely, because the fund was dormant and as such, the bank cannot transfer the fund to any of our nominated accounts. The source of the fund is as follows: I am the son of Late Dr. Khalifa Al-Madinah, the widow of Late General Sani Abacha the General waslam Husayb Abacha the son of Saddam Hussein the former Iraqi President who was recently impeached from office by the United States of America. My father was a very wealthy farmer and a close confidant of Saddam Hussein. Due to my father's untimely death, we did not declare any next of kin in our official papers, including the one submitted by my father's bank to the Bank of Nigeria in my name. The documentation is as stated in the Bank's file: As of the date of this pleading, the funds was approved for transfer to a security account in Europe.

FROM the fund transfer.  In view of this, I cannot invest this fund in your country.  I am the only son of the deceased. My father was a very wealthy farmer and a business man, but he was a rebel soldier in the war in Rwanda.  My father was poisoned to death by his business associates on one of their outings.  After the death of my father, we decided to move to the Republic of South Africa where he had deposited the sum of US$20.5 million (Twenty-five Million United States Dollars) in a security company.  This money was deposited in a box as gem stones for future storage.  The security company does not know the real contents of the box, as they never knew that the contents were diamond.  I am now in South Africa as asylum seekers and as political asylum seekers. My father's bank accounts in the Republic of South Africa and the Republic of Zimbabwe have both been frozen. I am contacting you now because of the present situation in my country and because of the present insecurity in my country, I do not have any other foreign partner or family members that can assist me in this transaction.  The amount in question is USD$20.5M. I want to transfer this money to your account as a personal beneficiary of the funds and my investment in your country, since I cannot invest this fund here in South Africa because of the political situation here and the law of South Africa prohibits asylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial transaction of any kind, hence this transaction.  I am very confident that this transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.  To start the transaction, I require your assistance in the following ways:  1. To assist me invest this fund in your country into a viable business in your country with the view of investing the fund in a high-quality establishment with lucrative investments in your country.  2. To secure a college for me and my younger brother in your country for us to continue our education in our country.  3. To make arrangement for me to come over to your country for onward transfer of the fund to your account as a result of my brother's death.  4. To make arrangement for me to come over to your country for onward transfer of the fund to your account as a result of my brother's death.  5.

FROM THE WHOLE HUMAN BANK SITUATION.  Dear Sir/Madam,  I am an international business consultant/associate based in a highly developed country of South Africa.  On the 21st of April 2000, a group of rebels broke into our security cation and killed our  security guard and took away a lot of documents.I and my colleague managed to get a lot of these documents from the security  vault system.We have access to some of these documents secured with some of  our bank clients documents that speaks very good of you and your company.  In the course of securing these documents, we discovered that the  management of my bank has secretly given us the names and addresses of all the  personnel of the security company that is responsible for the collection of these documents in our  custody.  I am presently in South Africa as an asylum seeker. I have  been mandated to provide a foreign account where we will transfer this funds.The money will be released to  mycare if I am able to provide an account in which it will be transferred.  I have two options for you; either to accept 20% of the total fund for your effort,  or accept 50% and transfer the remaining balance of 60% into a foreign account that will  be prepared by my foreign partner for us to share in the ratio of 60% for you and 35% for me.  I choose the latter since I do not have any child that will inherit this money.  I want to stress that you have to accept our decision because we are very young and we don't  have any other choice than to forgo our present and contribute to the development of  the fund.  It is our believe that you will be ofimmense help in this transaction.  I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us.

I am Mrs. Maryam Abass, the wife of late Mr. Safed Abass who was the director in charge of credit line at the Sudanese consignment that was seized by the rebels during the flight  of Mr. Sese Seko from his country Sudan in November 2000. We were both married for eleven years without a child. My husband died in January 2001 while I was still in school. Before his death, he has a Bank in Sudan and since his death a note was attached to deposit with the bank stating that he has the sum of US$20 Million (Twenty Million United State Dollars) in my care and it has been declared that the  security company has been unable to trace the beneficiary of the note because the note was lodged with the  Sudanese embassy in Daka- capital Sudan. Since we got the information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot extradite him because he has no family in Sudan.  My husband deposited the money in a bank here in Daka- capital Sudan and the bank officer came to my husband's   assistance and made some arrangements, but it was unfortunately discovered that he had no next of kin in Daka- capital Sudan,  because he has no wife and children.  My husband had deposited the money with the bank officer and the Sudanese consignment was declared to contain $35 Million United State Dollars (Thirty Five Million United State Dollars) which he had concealed in two trunk boxes, and declared it

THE ORIGIN OF THE CLAIM IS OF COURSE, HE DIED ALONGSIDE IN THE ACCRA-CHAMBER OF HIS CHATEAUX. THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  DEPARTMENT OF THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND  SOCIAL SERVICES IN DUBAI. THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN DUBAI  WAS CONCLUDED AFTER WE COULD NOT LOSE UP OUR POSITION AS A RESERVE  FUND CUSTOMERS. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF CONTRACTS IN THE PAST IS IN THE FOUR MILLION SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND  DOLLARS ($24.6M USD). THE MONEY was realised from the sale of  Diamonds and Precious stones/Metals by the British and American soldiers during the Gulf War  Between Saddam Hussein and Iran-backed rebels  Against our Government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in Iran-Iraq. The  money was then kept in a Security Company in Amsterdam by my son, and  secured as family valuables in a private security company, and  was then kept by my son in Amsterdam for safe keeping. The security company does not know the  real contents of the consignments it is loaded. The content of  the consignments is .5 Million US Dollars, which is US$4.5 Million  Dollars.  The security company does not know the real content of the consignments, since we have  access we can see the content without going to the  private security company.  I am writing you from Amsterdam as I have the opportunity  to write you based on this information from the security company. In  line with our internal processes for high net worth individuals, we  discovered that our sponsor company, a joint venture of one of the leading  Swiss construction magnates, has been awarded a contract of  contract worth US$4.5 million, which he will present to our  security company as the bonafide next of kin to my late  sponsor.  So our plan is to have him moved to Amsterdam as his next of kin  as we have not made any application for the  contract.

My father was a very wealthy cocoa merchant who based in Abidjan,  the economic capital of Cote d'Ivoire. My mother died when I was about ten years  old and since his death, I was the only child. Before my  development, my father always preached the importance of seeking  God for guidance and when necessary,bearing in mind that I  would never be able to see him because of my age. After my  father died, some months later, he called me  to his bedside and told me that he has the sum of  US$9,000,000(Nine Million USD) deposited  with a Security Company in Abidjan, he also told me that he  used my name as his only son for the deposit. I am now  eleven (11)years-old and just undergoing medical treatment in  the hospital.   I have since lost my ability to see and I have difficulty speaking and I have  difficulty moving around and I have this medical problem.   I have since lost my ability to see and I have this  stroke.   I took  special  care  of my father before burial and  I  have  taken  special  care of myself before  death.

My Husband was a top military official in the government of General Sani Abacha who was murdered on the 20th of April 1998 by the rebels following the unlawful murder of my husband by his bodyguards.  I am saddled with the problem of how to fund this investment.

====================
FROM THE BANK AND THE GOVERNMENT I HAVE IN MY POSSESSION THE SUM OF TWENTY MILLION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($30.3M USD) In my possession I have been deliberating on how to invest this money in a profitable investment for a while now, but as the management of my bank have started to question my integrity, I now decided to contact you to assist me in this transaction. I am a farmer from Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire who have been blessed by God with seven  Grand Lama  and the Ten  Sun Tzu's. I am 47 years old and I am presently on medical treatment. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.

I am 51years old and I am presently on a layoff from my job as a miner in South African where I am presently looking for a safe haven in South Africa.

In a nut shell, my name is Kenneth Williams the only son of late Dr. Jerry Williams, the former chief security officer and treasurer to the Late Nelson Mandela. My father was murdered in the land dispute in South Africa; I am the only son of late Dr. Jerry Williams. Before his death he was a very wealthy diamond and gold merchant in Johannesburg-douglas mining town, the economic capital of the Republic of Togo. Before his death I was a resident miner in south Africa; I was fortunate to escape with a very important deposit of US$30M (Thirty Million United States Dollars) in a safe keeping company in Europe. This money was deposited by my late father's son, who was a very wealthy businessman. My father was an early business man and a very rich businessman, he was also very wealthy in the western world; I am writing this from my laptop computer in my hospital bed during the time of my father's death. This money was deposited by my late father's son in a security company I have tried my  best to stop every steps to the correct release of this money but it has always been in my custody.  Due to the political situation in my country and the present political situation in Liberia, as the liberians have not renewed their support for the new leaders, I am seeking for a trustworthy foreign partner to assist me in investing this fund in your country.  I have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have
