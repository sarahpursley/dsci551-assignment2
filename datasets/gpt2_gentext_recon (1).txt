Before his death we were both born again  Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry  or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the  Bible is against.When my late husband was alive he  deposited the sum of$27.6Million (twenty-seven Million  six hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with one  finance/security company in Europe.  Presently, this money is still with the Security  Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not  last for the next three months due to cancer problem.  Though what disturbs me most is my stroke.   Having known my condition I decided to donate this  fund to church or better still a christian individual  that will utilize this money the way I am going to  instruct here in. I want a church or individual that  will use this to fund churches, orphanages and widows  propagating the word of God and to ensure that the  house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to  understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.  I took this decision because I don?t have any child  that will inherit this money and my husband relatives  are not Christians and I don?t want my husband?s hard  earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don?t  want a situation where this money will be used in an  ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold

Dear Sir/Madam, Greetings, I am Mr. Dan Patrick, a staff in Barclays bank, here in United Kingdom. However I got your contact through the International web directory. Recently we discovered a Dormant Account with a huge amount of Money Valued USD14, 000,000.00 (Fourteen Million Dollars only) that belongs to one of our late Customer who died in a plane crash. During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to MOHAMED KAMAL YASSER who died along with his wife and his two sons and the fund has been dormant in his account with this bank without any claim of the funds in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery of this development. The Banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for Six years, it will be forfeited to the Bank treasury as an unclaimed bill. It is only an outsider from the bank that can stand as a next of kin and It is upon this discovery that I decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out this dormant fund.  In order to avert this negative development, I on behalf of my trusted colleagues now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to our late customer so that the fund will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary next of kin, now that the bank is still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased, MOHAMED KAMAL YASSER. Please go through the website below to confirm this story www.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html We could have done this deal alone but because of our position in this country as civil servants, we can not do it on our own or with close friends because that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the time of transfer since we still work

Having known my condition I decided to donate this  fund to church or better still a christian individual  that will utilize this money the way I am going to  instruct here in. I want a church or individual that  will use this to fund churches, orphanages and widows  propagating the word of God and to ensure that the  house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to  understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.  I took this decision because I don?t have any child  that will inherit this money and my husband relatives  are not Christians and I don?t want my husband?s hard  earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don?t  want a situation where this money will be used in an  ungodly manner, hence the reason for me?s  letter of objection. I took this decision because  my health is not suitable to handle such amount of  money and

Attention: The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has a fixed deposit of US$22.1M,,, which its agents and approved contractors have been without a Contract for the past Six Months. What this implies is that your company has been approved to be the contractor for the contract.  This is unfortunate, as the contract awarded to Shell tolled Six Months ago was grossly overinvoiced, Now, with the increase of multinationals like you, our elected officials, and some well known bankers from our past, we can confirm that some of them has been paid the funds, while some have not.  This is so, our elected officials and some well known bankers are not aware of this and are giving us the false impression that the contract has been awarded. This is particularly true, which is true, the ANNPA has already paid all our contractors, some of whom have already been paid their salaries, while some have been paid nothing. In fact, some of our elected officials have already been paid their salaries, while our rich farmers have already died for, or been loothed by, the multinationals.  In fact, our farmers, as brave farmers and as workers, fought for their rights and the interests of the farmers.  In spite of all this, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)possesses an Over-invoiced amount of money totaling to about US$22,500,000.00 (Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) that is lying as a secret offshore account.  In order to avoid the suspicion and  suspicion of the authorities, my family and I have decided to seek for someone who will be capable and fit for the (UNITA) as a reserve force, as soon as the (UNITA) establishment, the fund will be transferred to the designated bank account that will be used for the proper verification and transfer of the fund into your nominated account, using your personal information.

FROM THE MONEY INTO A SAFE FOREIGN ACCOUNT.   My Dear,   I have a proposal for you,   It is my last and only hope alive.   I and my partner here in Amsterdam, Netherlands,   made a late deposit agreement with the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF)   concerning the sum of US$24.6, 000,000.00 (Twenty-four million,   Six hundred thousand US Dollars) in my bank.   This money was meant for investment as long as the bank   willed to the ownership of the Federal Government, as long as the   bank willed the money, then it will be your business to handle the   investments. However, before our   deposit with the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF) was made,   we had made good progress on the whole project before the death of   my partner, but the progress is being tested and   it is or was discovered that some of the fund was   lying dormant in our Bank.   This is the actual reason why it is imperative that you   confirm the funds in your bank   account and provide us with a foreign account where the fund   will be remitted.   I am contacting you to seek your cooperation on this urgent   matter so that we can proceed with the transfer of the fund into your   foreign account.   I hereby agree to act as the manager of the foreign   account for the payment of some of the   deposit cost while we   negotiate for a reasonable period of time for us to   share in the total fund amounting to be precise between   $4,000,000.00 (Four hundred   thousand dollars apart) with you for a mutual   interest benefit to be worked out.   The business itself is 100% safe, on   smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to   30% of the total sum as ratification, while the remaining   60% is for me.   I am willing to give you 20% while   all the major trading houses (countries, aidis and us) will be offering   great profit margin with respect to the purchase of the said   items.   Please, you should observe utmost confidentiality, and   be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable

FROM THE FACT THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW ME AND NEVER WILL BE  AFFIDAVIATION Greetings from the United States of America,  I am Mr. John Taylor, the purchasing director of Ceo Group PLC. I  have an urgent and very  confidential business proposition for you.  On october 15, 1999, our client Mr. Hatem Kamil Abdul  Fatah who was the deputy governor of Baghdad in Iraq  and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit  for 12 cartons, worth US$500,000, which he declared as Family Artifacts  that should be forwarded to any foreign charity home for  distribution. The fund has been in the security/finance company since  the  inception of the fund, but since the inception of no one has  come forward to claim the consignment with the claim of the fund  as the death of our client was the reason for the  transfer. The fund has now  been dormant in the security/finance company  since the inception of the fund, but since the  transfer of the fund to a foreign account with  no beneficiary, the fund has since been dormant  in the security/finance company with no beneficiary now that I  have made enquiries to locate any of my client  relatives for possible help. I have in my possession as  evidence the money that was transferred to the security/finance company  from the total sum of $25,000,000,00;and   the total amount owed has been in the security/finance company since  the inception of the fund, but since the  transfer of the fund to a foreign account with  no beneficiary, the money has since been dormant  in the security/finance company without any beneficiary form the  family.  It is my conviction that the consignment in the security/finance company  contains highly secret information about the deceased  and the consignment has been in the security/finance company since  the inception of the fund, but since the  transfer of the fund to a foreign account with  no beneficiary, the money has since been dormant  in the security/finance company without any beneficiary form the  family.

This mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignore it as unserious could come into your mind; but please consider it a divine wish and accept it with a deep sense of humility.  My name is Mrs. Juliana Faith Peters, a refugee from Macedonia. I was abused and neglected by my late husband. He was a strong farmer in Macedonia and was so hostile to my family's beliefs that we no longer belong to him, even though it is since my husband was murdered that we have not known a thing about his family.  Before the death of my husband, my husband told me that he has the sum of Eight Million, One Hundred Thousand Dollars (USD$8, 100 000 000) left in a security company in a mettalic trunk box, that he used my name as his next of kin in depositing of the fund.  I have no knowledge of a next of kin for this money, which was deposited with the security company as family treasures without any relation whatsoever.  No one will ever come forward to claim it.  Further investigations revealed that my husband deliberately concealed this money in the security company and the money has been dormant in his account with this company without any claim of the fund in any place in my name.  No one will ever come forward to claim it.  All attempts to trace the family member's next of kin have been fruitless, as all his relatives have been located and are facing trial in their portfolios for their role in the funds being hidden.  No one has come forward to claim the fund or any belonging to my husband.  No one knows the content of the secret because no one has come forward to claim it.

It has defied all forms of medical treatment, and  right now I have only about a few months to live,  according to medical experts.I have not particularly  lived my life so well, as I never really cared for  anyone(not even myself)but my business. Though I am  very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile  to people and only focused on my business as that was  the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this  as I now know that there is more to life than just  wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I  believe when God gives me a second chance to come to  this world I would live my life a different way from  how I have lived it.  Now that God has called me, I have willed and given  all my relatives, who have all the documents for the  first time been brought to my aid.  I want God to be merciful to me and accept my  soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity  organizations, which I have contacted before.

He died  after a brief illness that lasted for only four days.  Before his death, he deposited the sum of US$11.5MMBromin (US Dollars) with a Security Company  in South Africa,with a branch in London upon maturity,  to my knowledge no other person knows about this money or any other investment  that he made with the money. No one has ever come forward to claim and  claim the money. According to the South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South  African Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my doctor has advised me  not to become a widower nor raise a child outside the family home because of the dangers involved in such a thing,  because of the recent change in the South African Law, a man may hold the same amount of  as much as five million asiammuth asiammuth  (US Dollars) in his care, while a woman may give birth to a child with a belief that the blessings of  the Lord will not end with her.

Dear Sir, Greetings, I am Mr. Dan Patrick, a staff in Barclays bank, here in United Kingdom. However I got your contact through the International web directory. Recently we discovered a Dormant Account with a huge amount of Money Valued USD14, 000,000.00 (Fourteen Million Dollars only) that belongs to one of our late Customer who died in a plane crash. During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to MOHAMED KAMAL YASSER who died along with his wife and his two sons and the fund has been dormant in his account with this bank without any claim of the funds in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery of this development. The Banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for Six years, it will be forfeited to the Bank treasury as an unclaimed bill. It is only an outsider from the bank that can stand as a next of kin and It is upon this discovery that I decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out this dormant fund.  In order to avert this negative development, I on behalf of my trusted colleagues now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to our late customer so that the fund will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary next of kin, now that the bank is still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased, MOHAMED KAMAL YASSER.

I want a church or individual that  will use this to fund churches, orphanages and widows  propagating the word of God and to ensure that the  house of God is maintained.

I write to seek your cooperation on this issue.I am Mr. James NGOLA,the Chairman of Republic Bank of Senegal West Africa,West African Republic, with due respect and regards. Before I  write to you, I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash on the 26th December 1998 on airline transafrik International with aircraft Lockheed L-100-30 at location Vila Nova,Angola with registration number S9-CAO and since his untimely death the funds has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development. Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself and partners to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amount was US$24.1M (Twenty Four million One Hundred Thousand united states dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through a friends who works with the Ministry of Information here in Cotonou-Benin. It is him who recommended your person to me to be viable and capable to champion a business of such magnitude without any problem. Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased,get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit yourself to this great business opportunity. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant,we  are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into

I am a 55 years old man and a graduate of the medical school at the university where I worked as a sub-contractor during my three year contract with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. I was recently attacked by F.O.U. along with my mother and my younger sisters in a test field in lag crisis.  I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live.  It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations, because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them. Please, I beg you in the name of God to  help me Stand and collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God fearing that will use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows  propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to  understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that  will inherit this money and my father does not have any of this blessed Bible  books in him that will guide

I am the Director of Operations of the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas Company (NLNGCG), and the owner of an Air France Continental Flight number 904-04-01, which left from Lagos, Nigeria, at 9:15 am local time, July 14, 2001.  With due respect and regards, I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction.  During our investigation and auditing in the bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on July 14, 2001, at the age of 80 years, and his entire family has no knowledge of this fund.  This amount is (US$8.5M, eight million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). The said amount was an excess of the amount required to heat the underground storage tanks for the petroleum products (parsimony, octopuses and others) in the first week of production, which killed the deceased and his family before the fund was transfered to our custody.  It is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and does not allow us to operate a foreign account, making this the only known case of money transfered by a foreign account.  In order to avert this negative development, I on behalf of my trusted colleagues now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to the deceased so that the fund will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary next of kin, now that the bank is still expecting a next of kin or relative of the fund it was transfered as the next of kin to the late Mr. Jürgen Krügger, who died in a plane crash several years ago.  There was a claim made by my colleages that the deceased Mr. Jürgen Krügger was the beneficiary of the fund, but the

Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the  tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.

I got your name and  profile from the Internet when i was searching for a  reliable and trustworthy person to partner up with whom I could work  on various business projects together.  Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg for  the burial. On his deathbed he told me that he has  deposited the sum of $15.5 Million United States Dollars  Only in my Bank and that it will be deposited with a security company  in Europe. He advised me not to tell anybody except my mother who is  the last wife of the (8) eight wives that he married.  My mother did not bear any male child for him. Which  implies that all my father?s properties, companies  e.t.c., we have no share in them because my mother has  no male child according to African Tradition. My  father therefore secretly gave me all the relevant  documents of the said money, and told me that I should use this  money with my mother and my younger sisters  because he knows that tradtionally, if he dies we  cannnot get anything, as inheritance. He importantly  advised me that I should seek foreign assistannce and  that I should not invest this money here in Nigeria  because of his other wives and male children who  happen to be my elders. I am soliciting for your  immediate assistance to get a Bungalow for us, where I  will live with my mother and two younger sisters and  further advise me where and how I will invest the  balance money overseas, possibly on products of your  company and other profitable ventures.

FROM THE FUND FROM THE DESK OF  MR JERRY OZUBA  (B.O.T.)  Dear Friend,  I am sure you will understand.  I am a lawyer by profession and currently reside in South Africa as a  partier.  Before the death of my father, he had made a numbered copy of my birth certificate  and an addres thereto, for the purpose of  obtaining documents for a fictitious business venture in his  country.  On further investigation, I found out that my late father died without a  WILL, and the last rites were  taken on the 13th.  This is the story in its details but I believe it is  worth telling on the facts of the case  and the possibility of some innovative means to fund the  procedure and the expenses involved.  I also found out that the deceased did not declare any  next of kin or relations in all his official documents  including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$25,000,000.00 have been floating and  floating?s principal amount is that money that a foreigner with a  south African origin can demand in cash?s payment?s  presence? . I therefore made further investigation and discovered that  my late father did not declare any one of his  last names?  either in his official documents, or in the bank deposit?s  record. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my  Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at  the end of each year?s life? , according to British  law.  I made further investigation and discovered that my late father did  not declare any one of his last names?ed in any  of my bank deposit reports. This sum of  US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my  Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at  the end of each year?s life? , according to British  law.  I made further investigation and discovered that my late father did  not declare any one of his last names?ed in any  of my bank deposit reports.

FROM THE MAIL THROUGH MY PRIVATE EMAIL ADDRESS:  paulkangry50@yahoo.com  Dear Sir,  I am Mr. Paul kangry, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I plea to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Forty - Five Million, Five Hundred And Sixty Thousand U. S. Dollars ($45,560,000.) which we  want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount $45.560m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the  tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the $45.560 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe

JAMES NGOLA?  Yes.  Please.  Good Day.  I am the Chairman of the Contract Award Committee, Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Nigeria I am in charge of the Central Auditing and Accounting Office (LIBA) here in the United Arab Emirates. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$8.5M,(Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars)that was lying in the suspense/security account (B.A.) of one of our foreign partner governments before the financial crisis.  The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great industrialist and a resident of Alaska.   It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for our foreign partners to see through.  Because of the nature of offshore investment, especially in defense and peace producing fields, such as mines, fertilizers and construction chemicals, the value of the investment is usually much higher than what the customers has spent on the afore mentioned exploration, development and building activities.  Particularly, as the percentage of the total sum invested has increased in the last decade, the present local development policy has made it very difficult to get investment projects in your country.  This has encouraged us and others to follow this same trend, here in the United Arab Emirates we discovered a the sum of US$8.5M,(Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand US

FROM                                                 ', 'Urgent attention needed. My proposal to you. Dear Sir, I am Princess Adama  of the Sierra-Leone Islands, and Ruler of the Solomon Islands. I wish to request for your assistance in investing this sum in lucrative venture or manufacturing and real estate management in your country. I need your personal assistance to transfer this money which has long been deposited in the West African Bank by  asylum seekers to the bank. I will appreciate your willingness to assist me in receiving this money in your account because this money is  accumulated with the West African Liquefied Gas Development, and since the present Government  is bent on dealing with the problem, I am seeking for your assistance to transfer  this money into your country. I am soliciting for your assistance because the present South  Africa Government is seizing/freezing any Bank Account or valuables belonging to the  late Head of State and his family. The South Africa Government is bent on dealing with  this problem and right now is the only country where non-Aboriginal or  foreign persons are allowed to operate as officials. The request for your assistance as a foreigner  to stand in as the next of kin to the late Head of State, is occasioned by the fact that the deceased  was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. 40 % of this money will be for you as a foreign  beneficiary, 30 % will be set aside for expenses incurred during the  transaction and 60 % would be for me. There after I will come over to your  country for sharing the money. I will not fail to bring to your notice that  this  transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all  required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.

I was also married with two children. My wife and two children died in a car accident six years ago.  Before this happened my business and concern for making money was all I lived for. I never really cared about other values in life. But since the loss of my family, I have found a new desire to assist helpless families. I have been helping orphans in orphanage/motherless homes. I have also donated some money for humanitarian needs in Sudan, South Africa, Cameroon, Brazil, Spain, Austria, Germany and some Asian countries. !

FROM THE DEAL, FROM THE DEAR SIR, I AM MR. JAMES NGOLA, THE AUDITOR AND COMPUTING MANAGER OF MR DANIEL B.I. In order to transfer out (USD 65 MILLION) United  States Dollars.  from the Bank (CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA), the bank must approve  this money to any foreigner queued for the transfer. If such a  foreigner existed, the money could not be released to them as  against railable moneys belonging to a married couple, which poses a problem for me, as my  husband is a civil servant and as such, it is upon this  discovery that I decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out this dormant fund.  I contacted you because I feel that you are the only person that I am  going to target because I am not allowed to operate a foreign account. During the course of the transfer, my  late husband kept this money in the bank as an unclaimed bill, which he  would like to be paid out to any foreigner he knows.  As it may interest you to know, I am the cousin of Mr. Charles Eyadema, the ex-president of Liberia, who was killed and  partially escaped from the hands of the French during the recent coups and also lost her husband, the former president of Liberia, Heribert Mendoza.  My father was one of the biggest farmers in Liberia, and also operated a coffee and tin business in Liberia, which he committed with force of law and in good faith.  However, after the death of my father, my mother and I were thrown into a state of utter confusion and hopelessness by the incessant French and American bombing of our village, which we claimed as our own.  After the French and American attacks, I and my mother were allowed to move out of Liberia and now I stay in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum.  Due to the constant attacks from the French and American soldiers, I and my mother have decided to transfer my son to the Netherlands for onward transfer. I and my mother have decided to offer you 20% of the total sum, 5% will be for any expenses that may  incure during the transfer, while the remaining 65% will be for you during the spent funds.

I want a church or individual that  will use this to fund churches, orphanages and widows  propagating the word of God and to ensure that the  house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to  understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.  I took this decision because I don?t have any child  that will inherit this money and my husband relatives  are not Christians and I don?t want my husband?s hard  earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don?t  want a situation where this money will be used in an  ungodly manner, hence

The Banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for Six years, it will be forfeited to the Bank treasury as an unclaimed bill.

In order to avert this negative development, I on behalf of my trusted colleagues now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to our late customer so that the fund will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary next of kin, now that the bank is still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased, MOHAMED KAMAL YASSER.
